F.Y. ECCLES</h3>
<br>





<p>MY DEAR ECCLES,</p>

<p>You will, I know, permit me to address you these essays
which are more the product of your erudition than of my enthusiasm.</p>

<p>With the motives of their appearance you are familiar.</p>

<p>We have wondered together that a society so avid of experience
and enlargement as is ours, should ignore the chief expression of its
closest neighbour, its highest rival and its coheir in Europe: should
ignore, I mean, the literature of the French.</p>

<p>We have laughed together, not without despair, to see the mind
of England, for all its majesty and breadth, informed at the most
critical moments in the policy of France by such residents of Paris as
were at the best fanatical, at the worst (and most ordinary) corrupt.</p>

<p>Seeing around us here a philosophy and method drawn from northern
Germany, a true and subtle sympathy with the Italians, and a
perpetual, just and accurate comment upon the minor nationalities
of Europe, a mass of recorded travel superior by far to that of other
countries, we marvelled that France in particular should have remained
unknown.</p>

<p>We were willing, in an earlier youth, to read this riddle in somewhat
crude solutions. I think we have each of us arrived, and in a
final manner, at the sounder conclusion that historical accident is
principally to blame. The chance concurrence of this defeat with
that dynastic influence, the slip by which the common sense of
political simplicity missed footing in England and fell a generation
behind, the marvellous industrial activities of this country, protected
by a tradition of political discipline which will remain unique in
History; the contemporaneous settling down of France into the
equilibrium of power--an equilibrium not established without five
hearty civil wars and perhaps a hundred campaigns--all these so
separated the two worlds of thought as to leave France excusable
for her blindness towards the destinies and nature of England, and
England excusable for her continued emptiness of knowledge upon
the energy and genius of France: though these were increasing
daily, immensely, at our very side.</p>

<p>We have assisted at some straining of such barriers. A long peace,
the sterility of Germany, the interesting activities of the Catholic
Church, have perhaps not yet changed, but have at least disturbed
the mind of the north, and ours, a northern people's, with it. The
unity, the passionate patriotism, the close oligarchic polity, the very
silence of the English has arrested the eyes of France. By a law
which is universal where bodies are bound in one system, an extreme
of separation has wrought its own remedy and the return towards
a closer union is begun. I do not refer to such ephemeral and artificial
manifestations as a special and somewhat humiliating need
may demand; I consider rather that large sweep of tendency which
was already apparent fifteen years after the Franco-Prussian War.
An approach in taste, manners and expression well defined during
our undergraduate years, has now introduced much of our inmost
life to the French, to us already a hint of their philosophy.</p>

<p>I think you believe, as I do, that the return has begun.</p>

<p>We shall not live to see that fine unity of the west which lent
the latter seventeenth and eighteenth centuries their classical repose.
No common rule of verse or prose will satisfy men's permanent
desire for harmony: no common rule of manners, of honour, of international
ethics, of war. We shall not live to see, though we are
young now, a Paris reading some new Locke or Hume, a London
moved to attentive delight in some latter trinity of Dramatists, some
future Voltaire.... The high, protected class, which moved at
ease between the Capitals of the World, has disappeared; that which
should take its place is not yet formed. We are both of that one
Faith which can but regard our Christendom as the front of mankind
and which, therefore, looks forward, as to a necessary goal, to
the re-establishment of its common comprehension. But the reversion
to such stability is slow. We shall not live to see it.</p>

<p>It is none the less our duty (if I may use a word of so unsavoury
a connotation) to advance the accomplishment of this good fatality.</p>

<p>Not indeed that a vulgar cosmopolitan beatitude can inspire an
honest man. To abandon one's patriotism, and to despise a frontier
or a flag, is, we are agreed, the negation of Europe. There are
Frenchmen who forget their battles, and Englishmen to whom a
gold mine, a chance federal theory, a colonial accent, or a map, is
more of an inheritance than the delicate feminine profile of Nelson
or the hitherto unbroken traditions of our political scheme. To
such men arms are either abhorrent, or, what is worse, a very
cowardly (and thank God! unsuccessful) method of acquiring or
defending their very base enjoyments. Let us forget them. It is
only as nationalists, and only in an intense sympathy with the highly
individual national unities of Europe that we may approach the
endeavour of which I have spoken.</p>

<p>With us, I fear, that endeavour must take a literary form, but
such a channel is far from ignoble or valueless. He that knows
some part of the letters of a foreign nation, be it but the graces or
even the vagaries of such letters, knows something of that nation's
mind. To portray for the populace one religion welding the west
together, to spread a common philosophy, or to interpret and arrange
political terms, would certainly prove a more lasting labour: but
you will agree with me that mere sympathy in letters is not to be
despised.</p>

<p>We have observed together that the balance in this matter is
heavily against the English. M. Jusserand is easily the first authority
upon popular life in England at the close of the middle ages.
M. Boutmy has produced an analysis of our political development
which our Universities have justly recognized. Our friend M. Angellier
of the École Normale has written what is acknowledged by
the more learned Scotch to be the principal existing monograph
upon Robert Burns; Mr. Kipling himself has snatched the attention
of M. Chevrillon. You know how many names might be added
to this list to prove the close, applied and penetrating manner in
which French scholars have latterly presented our English writers
to their fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>We have both believed that something of the sort might be
attempted in the converse; that a view could be given--a glimpse
at least--of that vast organism whose foundations are in Rome,
Coeval with the spring of Christianity, and whose last growth seems
as vigorous and as fecund as though it were exempt from any
laws of age.</p>

<p>But, I say, we know how heavy is the balance against us.</p>

<p>The Gallic ritual is unrecognized, even by our over-numerous
class of clerical antiquarians. The Carolingian cycle is neglected,
save perhaps for a dozen men who have seen the Song of Roland.
The Complaints of Rusteboeuf, the Fabliaux, all the local legendary
poetry, all the chroniclers (save Froissart--for he wrote of us), the
tender simplicity of Joinville, the hard steel of Villehardouin, no
one has handled.</p>

<p>The fifteenth century, the storm of the Renaissance, are not
taught. Why, Rabelais himself might be but an unfamiliar name
had not a northern squire of genius rendered to the life three
quarters of his work.</p>

<p>The list is interminable. Even the great Drama of the great
century is but a text for our schools leaving no sort of trace upon
the mind: and as for the French moderns (I have heard it from
men of liberal education) they are denied to have written any poetry
at all: so exact, so subtle, so readily to be missed, are the proportions
of their speech.</p>

<p>If you ask me why I should myself approach the matter, I can
plead some inheritance of French blood, comparable, I believe, to
your own; and though I have no sort of claim to that unique and
accomplished scholarship which gives you a mastery of the French
tongue unmatched in England, and a complete familiarity with its
history, application and genius, yet I can put to my credit a year
of active, if eccentric, experience in a French barrack room, and a
complete segregation during those twelve memorable months
wherein I could study the very soul of this sincere, creative, and
tenacious people.</p>

<p>Your learning, my singular adventure, have increased in us, it
must be confessed, a permanent and reasoned admiration for this
people's qualities. Such an attitude of mind is rare enough and
often dangerous: it is but a qualification the more for beginning
the work. It permits us to follow the main line of the past of the
French, to comprehend and not to be troubled by the energy of
their present, to catch the advancing omens of their future.</p>

<p>Indeed, if anything of France is to be explained in English and
to people reading English, I could not desire a better alliance than
yours and mine.</p>

<p>But if you ask me why the Renaissance especially--or why in the
Renaissance these six poets alone--should have formed the subject
of my first endeavour, I can only tell you that in so vast a province,
whereof the most ample leisure could not in a lifetime exhaust a
tithe, Chance, that happy Goddess, led me at random to their
groves.</p>

<p>Whether it will be possible to continue such interpretation I do
not know, but if it be so possible, I know still less what next may
be put into my hands: Racine, perhaps, may call me, or those forgotten
men who urged the Revolution with phrases of fire.</p>

<h2>CHARLES OF ORLEANS.</h2>

<p>I put down Charles of Orleans here as the first representative
of that long glory which it is the business of this
little book to recall: but to give him such a place at the
threshold requires some apology.</p>

<p>The origins of a literary epoch differ according as that
epoch is primal or derivative. There are those edifices of
letters which start up, not indeed out of nothing, but out
of things wholly different. Produced by a shock or a
revelation, as two gases lit will, in a sharp explosion, unite
to form a liquid wholly unlike either, so after a great conquest,
a battle, the sudden preaching of a creed, these
primal literatures appear in an epic or a dithyrambic code
of awful law. Their first effort is their mightiest. They
come mature. They are allied to that element of the
catastrophic which the modern world (taking its general
philosophy from its social condition) denies, but which is
yet at the limits of all things separate and themselves;
accompanies every birth, and strikes agony into every
transition of death.</p>

<p>Those other much commoner epochs in the history of
letters, which may be called derivative, have this current
and obvious quality, that their beginnings merge into
the soil that bred them, also (very often) their decay will
lapse imperceptibly into newer things. They are quite
definite, but also definitely parented. We know their
special stuff and harmony, but we can point out clearly
enough the elements which formed that stuff, the tones
which unite in that harmony. We can show with dates
and citations the parts meeting and blending; our difficulty
is not to determine the influences which have mixed to
make the general school, but rather to fix the beginning
and the end of its effect upon men.</p>

<p>In the first of these the leader, sometimes the unique
example of the school, stands out great, but particular
and clear, on a background vague or dark. He is as
stupendous, yet as sharp and certain, as a mountain facing
the morning, with only sky behind. In the second the
originator, if there be one, is vague, tentative, perhaps unknown.
More often many minor men together introduce
a slow and general transition.</p>

<p>Now the French Renaissance has this peculiar mark,
that it holds quite plainly by one side of it to the first by
the other to the second of these spirits.</p>

<p>It was primal and catastrophic in that it made something
completely new. A new architecture, new cities, a new
poetry, almost a new language, a new kind of government--ultimately
the modern world.</p>

<p>It was derivative in that the shock, the revelation, which
produced it, was the return of something allied to the
French blood, something rooted in the French memory.
Rome surviving or risen had made that Italy, which was
now beginning to trouble the Alps, and would surely creep in
by every channel of influence, and at last pervade all Europe.
Rome, also, in her full vigour, had once framed and ordered
Gaul. The French of the Renaissance were woken suddenly,
but as they started they recognized the face and the hand
of the awakener.</p>

<p>On this account you will find one mind indeed at the
very beginning of the change in letters, but not a dominating
mind. There is but one man who is certainly an origin,
but he is not a master. You see an unique and single personality,
distinct but without force, founding no school--the
grave, abiding, kind but covert face of Charles of
Orleans. He, linked to the French Renaissance, is like the
figure of a gentle friend playing in some garden with a
child whose manners are new and pleasing to him, but of
whose great destiny he makes no guess. That child was to
be Du Bellay, Brantome, Montaigne a hundred-sided, huge
Rabelais, Ronsard. Or perhaps this metaphor will put it
better. To say that Charles of Orleans's equal and persistent
music was like a string harped on distinctly in a chorus
of flutes and hautboys, till one by one harps from here and
there caught up the similar tang of chords and at last the
whole body of sound was harping only.</p>

<p>His life was suited to such difference and such origination.
Italy, still living, filled him. An Italian secretary
wrote from his mouth the most sumptuous of his manuscripts.
He banded on Italy as a goal and his Italian land
as a legacy to the French crown--to his own son; till (years
after his death) the soldiers roared through Briançon and
broke the crusted snow of Mont Genèvre. An Italian
mother, the most beautiful of the Viscontis, come out of
Italy, rich in her land of Asti and her half million of pure
gold, had borne him in her youth to the King of France's
brother: a man luxurious, over fine, exact in taste, a lover
of magnificence in stories and words, decadent in a dying
time, very brave. Through that father the Valois blood,
unjustly hated or still more unjustly despised according to
the varied ignorance of modern times, ran in him nobly.</p>

<p>Take the Valois strain entire and you will find the pomp
or rather the fantasy of their great palace of St. Paul;
turrets and steep blue roofs of slate, carved woodwork,
heavy curtains, and incense and shining bronze. The
Valois were, indeed, the end of the middle ages. Some
cruelty, a fury in battle, intelligence and madness alternately,
and always a sort of keenness which becomes now revenge,
now foresight, now intrigue, now strict and terrible government:
at last a wild adventure out beyond the hills: Fornovo,
Pavia.</p>

<p>Their story is like the manuscripts, which beyond all other
things they loved and collected, and which they were the
last to possess or to have made; for while it contains in
vivid pictures the noblest and the basest subjects: (Joan of
Arc and also her betrayal, their country dominant and almost
engulfed, Marigano, and then again Pavia) it always glitters
with hard enamelled colours against skies of gold, and is
drawn and sharp and clean as a thing can be.</p>

<p>Such is the whole line, but look at this one Valois and
you see all the qualities of his race toned by a permanent
sadness down to a good and even temper, not hopeful but
still delighting in beauty and possessed as no other Valois
had been of charity. Less passionate and therefore much
less eager and useful than most of his race, yet the taint of
madness never showed in him, nor the corresponding evil
of cruelty, nor the uncreative luxury of his immediate
ancestry. All the Valois were poets in their kind; his life
by its every accident caused him to write. At fifteen they
wedded him to that lovely child whom Richard II had
lifted in his arms at Windsor as he rode out in fatal pomp
for Ireland. Three years later, when their marriage was real,
she died in childbirth, and it is to her I think that he wrote
in his prison the ballad which ends:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i16">Dieu sur tout souverain seigneur</p>
<p class="i16">Ordonnez par grace et douceur</p>
<p class="i16">De l'ame d'elle tellement</p>
<p class="i16">Qu'elle ne soit pas longuement</p>
<p class="i16">En peine souci et douleur.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Already, in the quarrel that so nearly wrecked the crown,
the anti-national factions had killed his father. He was planning
vengeance, engraving little mottoes of hate upon his
silver, when the wars came on them all. A boy of twenty-four,
well-horsed, much more of a soldier than he later
seemed, he charged, leading the centre of the three tall
troops at Agincourt. In the evening of that disaster they
pulled him out from under a great heap of the ten thousand
dead and brought him prisoner into England, to Windsor
then to Pomfret Castle. Chatterton, Cobworth, at last John
Cornwall, of Fanhope, were his guardians. To some one
of these--probably the last--he wrote the farewell:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i12">Mon très bon hôte et ma très douce hôtesse.</p>
</div></div>

<p>For his life as a prisoner, though melancholy, was not
undignified; he paid no allegiance, he met the men of his
own rank, nor was he of a kind to whom poverty, the chief
thorn of his misfortune, brought dishonour.</p>

<p>Henry V had left it strictly in his will that Orleans the
general and the head of the French nationals should not
return. For twenty-five years, therefore--all his manhood--he
lived under this sky, rhyming and rhyming: in English
a little, in French continually, and during that isolation there
swept past him far off in his own land the defence, the
renewal, the triumph of his own blood: his town relieved,
his cousin crowned at Rheims. His river of Loire, and then
the Eure, and then the Seine, and even the field where he
had fallen were reconquered. Willoughby had lost Paris to
Richemont four years before Charles of Orleans was freed
on a ransom of half his mother's fortune. It was not until
the November of 1440 that he saw his country-side again.</p>

<p>The verse formed in that long endurance (a style which
he preserved to the end in the many poems after his release)
may seem at a first reading merely mediæval. There is
wholly lacking in it the riot of creation, nor can one see
at first the Renaissance coming in with Charles of Orleans.</p>

<p>Indeed it was laid aside as mediæval, and was wholly
forgotten for three hundred years. No one had even heard
of him for all those centuries till Sallier, that learned priest,
pacing, full of his Hebrew and Syriac, the rooms of the
royal library which Louis XV had but lately given him to
govern, found the manuscript of the poems and wrote an
essay on them for the Academy.</p>

<p>The verse is full of allegory; it is repetitive; it might
weary one with the savour of that unhappy fifteenth century
when the human mind lay under oppression, and only the
rich could speak their insignificant words; a foreigner
especially might find it all dry bones, but his judgement
would be wrong. Charles of Orleans has a note quite new
and one that after him never failed, but grew in volume
and in majesty until it filled the great chorus of the Pleiade--the
Lyrical note of direct personal expression. Perhaps the
wars produced it in him; the lilt of the marching songs
was still spontaneous:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">Gentil Duc de Lorraine, vous avez grand renom,</p>
<p class="i8">Et votre renommée passe au delà des monts</p>
<p class="i8">Et vous et vos gens d'arme, et tous vos compagnons</p>
<p class="i8">Au premier coup qu'ils frappent, abattent les Donjons.</p>
<p class="i8">Tirez, tirez bombardes, serpentines, Canons!</p>
</div></div>

<p>Whatever the cause, this spontaneity and freshness run
through all the mass of short and similar work which he
wrote down.</p>

<p>The spring and sureness, the poise of these light nothings
make them a flight of birds.</p>

<p>See how direct is this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">Dieu! qu'il la fait bon regarder!</p>
<p class="i8">La gracieuse, bonne et belle.</p>
</div></div>

<p>or this:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">Le lendemain du premier jour de Mai</p>
<p class="i8">Dedans mon lit ainsi que je dormoye</p>
<p class="i8">Au point du jour advint que je sonjeay.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Everywhere his words make tunes for themselves and
everywhere he himself appears in his own verses, simple,
charming, slight, but with memories of government and of
arms.</p>

<p>This style well formed, half his verse written, he returned
to his own place. He was in middle age--a man of fifty.
He married soberly enough Mary of Cleves, ugly and
young: he married her in order to cement the understanding
with Burgundy. She did not love him with his shy
florid face, long neck and features and mild eyes. His age
for twenty-five years passed easily, he had reached his
"castle of No Care." As late as 1462 his son (Louis XII)
was born; his two daughters at long intervals before. His
famous library moved with him as he went from town to
town, and perpetually from himself and round him from
his retinue ran the continual stream of verse which only
ended with his death. His very doctor he compelled to
rhyme.</p>

<p>All the singers of the time visited or remained with
him--wild Villon for a moment, and after Villon a crowd
of minor men. It was in such a company that he recited
the last ironical but tender song wherein he talks of his
lost youth and vigour and ends by bidding all present a
salute in the name of his old age.</p>

<p>So he sat, half regal, holding a court of song in Blois
and Tours, a forerunner in verse of what the new time was
to build in stone along the Loire. And it was at Amboise
that he died.</p>

<br>
<h3>THE COMPLAINT.</h3>

<p class="mid">(<i><b>The 57th Ballade of those written during his imprisonment.</b></i>)</p>





<p>There is some dispute in the matter, but I will believe,
as I have said, that this dead Princess, for whose soul he
prays, was certainly the wife of his boyhood, a child whom
Richard II had wed just before that Lancastrian usurpation
which is the irreparable disaster of English history.
She was, I say, a child--a widow in name--when Charles
of Orleans, himself in that small royal clique which was
isolated and shrivelling, married her as a mere matter of
state. It is probable that he grew to love her passionately,
and perhaps still more her memory when she had died in
child-bed during those first years, even before Agincourt,
"en droicte fleur de jeunesse,"--for even here he is able to
find an exact and sufficient line.</p>

<p>There is surely to be noted in this delicate ballad, something
more native and truthful in its pathos than in the
very many complaints he left by way partly of reminiscence,
partly of poetic exercise. For, though he is restrained, as
was the manner of his rank when they attempted letters,
yet you will not read it often without getting in you a share
of its melancholy.</p>

<p>That melancholy you can soon discover to be as permanent
a quality in the verse as it was in the mind of
the man who wrote it.</p>

<h3>THE TWO ROUNDELS OF SPRING.</h3>

<p class="mid">(<i><b>The 41st and 43rd of the "Rondeaux."</b></i>)</p>





<p>These two Rondeaux, of which we may also presume,
though very vaguely, that they were written in England
(for they are in the manner of his earlier work), are by far
the most famous of the many things he wrote; and justly,
for they have all these qualities.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, they are exact specimens of their style. The
Roundel should interweave, repeat itself, and then recover
its original strain, and these two exactly give such unified
diversity.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>: they were evidently written in a moment of
that unknown power when words suggest something fuller
than their own meaning, and in which simplicity itself
broadens the mind of the reader. So that it is impossible
to put one's finger upon this or that and say this adjective,
that order of the words has given the touch of vividness.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>: they have in them still a living spirit of reality;
read them to-day in Winter, and you feel the Spring. It is
this quality perhaps which most men have seized in them,
and which have deservedly made them immortal.</p>

<p>A further character which has added to their fame, is
that, being perfect lyrics, they are also specimens of an
old-fashioned manner and metre peculiar to the time. They
are the resurrection not only of the Spring, but of a Spring
of the fifteenth century. Nor is it too fantastic to say that
one sees in them the last miniatures and the very dress of
a time that was intensely beautiful, and in which Charles
of Orleans alone did not feel death coming.</p>

<p>It does indeed defy death and leaps four centuries: it is

middle ages had forgotten: it reaches what they never
reached, a climax, for one cannot put too vividly the flash
of the penultimate line, "I am granted a vision when I
think of her."</p>

<p>Yet it was written in later life, and who she was, or
whether she lived at all, no one knows.</p>

<h3>THE FAREWELL.</h3>

<p class="mid">(<i><b>The 310th Roundel.</b></i>)</p>

<p>Here is the last thing--we may presume--that Charles of
Orleans ever wrote: "Salute me all the company, I pray."</p>

<p>In that "company" not only the Court at Amboise, but
the men of the early wars, his companions, were round him,
and the dead friends of his gentle memory.</p>

<p>He was broken with age; he was already feeling the
weight of isolation from the Royal Family; he was beginning
to suffer the insults of the king. But, beneath all this,
his gaiety still ran like a river under ice, and in the ageing
of a poet, humour and physical decline combined make a
good, human thing.</p>

<p>There is an excellent irony in the refrain: "Salute me,
all the company," whose double interpretation must not
be missed, though it may seem far-fetched.</p>

<p>Till the last line it means, without any question, "Salute
the company in my name," but I think there runs through
it also, the hint of "Salute me for my years, all you present
who are young," and that this certainly is the note in the
last line of all. It must be remembered of the French, that
they never expand or explain their ironical things, for in
art it is their nature to detest excess.</p>

<p>This last thing of his, then, I say, is the most characteristic
of him and of his Valois blood, and of the national
spirit in general to which he belonged: for he, and it,
and they, loved and love contrast, and the extra-meaning
of words.</p>

<h2>VILLON.</h2>

<p>I have said that in Charles of Orleans the middle ages are
at first more apparent than the advent of the Renaissance.
His forms are inherited from an earlier time, his terminology
is that of the long allegories which had wearied three
generations, his themes recall whatever was theatrical
in the empty pageantry of the great war. It is a spirit
deeper and more fundamental than the mere framework of
his writing which attaches him to the coming time. His
clarity is new; it proceeds from natural things; it marks
that return to reality which is the beginning of all beneficent
revolutions. But this spirit in him needs examination and
discovery, and the reader is confused between the mediaeval
phrases and the something new and troubling in the voice
that utters them.</p>

<p>With Villon, the next in order, a similar confusion
might arise. All about him as he wrote were the middle
ages: their grotesque, their contrast, their disorder. His
youth and his activity of blood forbad him any contact with
other than immediate influences. He was wholly Northern;
he had not so much as guessed at what Italy might be.
The decrepit University had given him, as best she could,
the dregs of her palsied philosophy and something of Latin.
He grew learned as do those men who grasp quickly the
major lines of their study, but who, in details, will only be
moved by curiosity or by some special affection. There
was nothing patient in him, and nothing applied, and in all
this, in the matter of his scholarship as in his acquirement
of it, he is of the dying middle ages entirely.</p>

<p>His laughter also was theirs: the kind of laughter that
saluted the first Dance of Death which as a boy he had
seen in new frescoes round the waste graveyard of the Innocents.
His friends and enemies and heroes and buffoons
were the youth of the narrow tortuous streets, his visions
of height were the turrets of the palaces and the precipitate
roofs of the town. Distance had never inspired him, for in
that age its effect was forgotten. No one straight street
displayed the greatness of the city, no wide and ordered
spaces enhanced it. He crossed his native river upon
bridges all shut in with houses, and houses hid the banks
also. The sweep of the Seine no longer existed for his
generation, and largeness of all kinds was hidden under the
dust and rubble of decay. The majestic, which in sharp
separate lines of his verse he certainly possessed, he discovered
within his own mind, for no great arch or cornice,
nor no colonnade had lifted him with its splendour.</p>

<p>That he could so discover it, that a solemnity and order
should be apparent in the midst of his raillery whenever he
desires to produce an effect of the grand, leads me to speak
of that major quality of his by which he stands up out of
his own time, and is clearly an originator of the great renewal.
I mean his vigour.</p>

<p>It is all round about him, and through him, like a storm
in a wood. It creates, it perceives. It possesses the man
himself, and us also as we read him. By it he launches his
influence forward and outward rather than receives it from
the past. To it his successors turn, as to an ancestry, when
they had long despised and thrown aside everything else
that savoured of the Gothic dead. By it he increased in
reputation and meaning from his boyhood on for four
hundred years, till now he is secure among the first lyric
poets of Christendom. It led to no excess of matter, but
to an exuberance of attitude and manner, to an inexhaustibility
of special words, to a brilliancy of impression unique
even among his own people.</p>

<p>He was poor; he was amative; he was unsatisfied. This
vigour, therefore, led in his actions to a mere wildness;
clothed in this wildness the rare fragments of his life have
descended to us. He professed to teach, but he haunted
taverns, and loved the roaring of songs. He lived at random
from his twentieth year in one den or another along
the waterside. Affection brought him now to his mother,
now to his old guardian priest, but not for long; he returned
to adventure--such as it was. He killed a man, was arrested,
condemned, pardoned, exiled; he wandered and
again found Paris, and again--it seems--stumbled down
his old lane of violence and dishonour.</p>

<p>Associated also with this wildness is a curious imperfection
in our knowledge of him. His very name is not
his own--or any other man's. His father, if it were his
father, took his name from Mont-Corbier--half noble.
Villon is but a little village over beyond the upper Yonne,
near the division, within a day of the water-parting where
the land falls southward to Burgundy and the sun in what
they call "The Slope of Gold." From this village a priest,
William, had come to Paris in 1423. They gave him a
canonry in that little church called "St. Bennets Askew,"
which stood in the midst of the University, near Sorbonne,
where the Rue des Écoles crosses the Rue St. Jacques
to-day. Hither, to his house in the cloister, he brought
the boy, a waif whom he had found much at the time
when Willoughby capitulated and the French recaptured
the city. He had him taught, he designed him for the
University, he sheltered him in his vagaries, he gave him
asylum. The young man took his name and called him
"more than father." His anxious life led on to 1468, long
after the poet had disappeared.</p>

<p>For it is in 1461, in his thirtieth year, that Villon last
writes down a verse. It is in 1463 that his signature is last
discovered. Then not by death or, if by death, then by
some death unrecorded, he leaves history abruptly--a most
astonishing exit!... You may pursue fantastic legends,
you will not find the man himself again. Some say a final
quarrel got him hanged at last--it is improbable: no record
or even tradition of it remains. Rabelais thought him a
wanderer in England. Poitou preserves a story of his later
passage through her fields, of how still he drank and sang
with boon companions, and of how, again, he killed a
man.... Maybe, he only ceased to write; took to teaching
soberly in the University, and lived in a decent inheritance
to see new splendours growing upon Europe. It may
very well be, for it is in such characters to desire in early
manhood decency, honour, and repose. But for us the man
ends with his last line. His body that was so very real,
his personal voice, his jargon--tangible and audible things--spread
outward suddenly a vast shadow upon nothingness.
It was the end, also, of a world. The first Presses
were creaking, Constantinople had fallen, Greek was in
Italy, Leonardo lived, the stepping stones of the Azores
were held--in that new light he disappears.</p>

<hr>

<p>Of his greatness nothing can be said; it is like the greatness
of all the chief poets, a thing too individual to seize
in words. It is superior and exterior to the man. Genius
of that astounding kind has all the qualities of an extraneous
thing. A man is not answerable for it. It is
nothing to his salvation; it is little even to his general
character. It has been known to come and go, to be put
off and on like a garment, to be lent by Heaven and taken
away, a capricious gift.</p>

<p>But of the manner of that genius it may be noted that,
as his vigour prepared the flood of new verse, so in another
matter his genius made him an origin. Through him first,
the great town--and especially Paris--appeared and became
permanent in letters.</p>

<p>Her local spirit and her special quality had shone fitfully
here and there for a thousand years--you may find it in
Julian, in Abbo, in Joinville. But now, in the fifteenth
century, it had been not only a town but a great town for
more than a century--a town, that is, in which men live
entirely, almost ignorant of the fields, observing only other
men, and forgetting the sky. The keen edge of such a life,
its bitterness, the mockery and challenge whereby its evils
are borne, its extended knowledge, the intensity of its
spirit--all these are reflected in Villon, and first reflected
in him. Since his pen first wrote, a shining acerbity like
the glint of a sword-edge has never deserted the literature
of the capital.</p>

<p>It was not only the metropolitan, it was the Parisian
spirit which Villon found and fixed. That spirit which is
bright over the whole city, but which is not known in the
first village outside; the influence that makes Paris Athenian.</p>

<p>The ironical Parisian soul has depths in it. It is so lucid
that its luminous profundity escapes one--so with Villon.
Religion hangs there. Humility--fatally divorced from
simplicity--pervades it. It laughs at itself. There are
ardent passions of sincerity, repressed and reacting upon
themselves. The virtues, little practised, are commonly
comprehended, always appreciated, for the Faith is there
permanent. All this you will find in Villon, but it is too
great a matter for so short an essay as this.</p>

<br>

<h3>THE DEAD LADIES.</h3>

<p>It is difficult or impossible to compare the masterpieces of
the world. It is easy and natural to take the measure of
a particular writer and to establish a scale of his work.</p>

<p>Villon is certainly in the small first group of the poets.
His little work, like that of Catullus, like that of Gray, is
up, high, completed and permanent. And within that
little work this famous Ballade is by far the greatest
thing.</p>

<p>It contains all his qualities: not in the ordinary proportion
of his character, but in that better, exact proportion
which existed in him when his inspiration was most ardent:
for the poem has underlying it somewhere a trace of his
irony, it has all his ease and rapidity--excellent in any poet--and
it is carried forward by that vigour I have named,
a force which drives it well upwards and forward to its
foaming in the seventh line of the third verse.</p>

<p>The sound of names was delightful to him, and he loved
to use it; he had also that character of right verse, by
which the poet loves to put little separate pictures like
medallions into the body of his writing: this Villon loved,
as I shall show in other examples, and he has it here.</p>

<p>The end of the middle ages also is strongly in this appeal
or confession of mortality; their legends, their delicacy,
their perpetual contemplation of death.</p>

<p>But of all the Poem's qualities, its run of words is far
the finest.</p>

<h3>AN EXCERPT FROM THE GRANT TESTAMENT.</h3>

<p class="mid">(<i><b>Stanzas 75-79.</b></i>)</p>



<p>Villon's whole surviving work is in the form of two
rhymed wills--one short, one long: and in the latter,
Ballads and Songs are put in each in their place, as the
tenour of the verse suggests them.</p>

<p>Thus the last Ballade, that of the "Dead Ladies," comes
after a couple of strong stanzas upon the necessity of death--and
so forth.</p>

<p>One might choose any passage, almost, out of the mass
to illustrate the character of this "Testament" in which
the separate poems are imbedded. I have picked those
round about the 800th line, the verses in which he is perhaps
least brilliant and most tender.</p>

<h3>THE BALLADE OF OUR LADY.</h3>

<p class="mid">(<i><b>Written by Villon for his mother.</b></i>)</p>



<p>The abrupt ending of the last extract, the 79th stanza of
the "Grant Testament"--"I give..." and then no objective
(apparently) added--is an excellent example of the
manner in which the whole is conceived and of the way in
which the separate poems are pieced into the general work.</p>

<p>What "he gives..." to his mother is this "Ballade of
our Lady," written, presumably, long before the "will"
and put in here and thus after being carefully led up to.</p>

<p>These thirty-seven lines are more famous in their own
country than abroad. They pour from the well of a religion
which has not failed in the place where Villon wrote, and
they present that religion in a manner peculiar and national.</p>

<p>Apart from its piety and its exquisite tenderness, two
qualities of Villon are to be specially found in this poem:
his vivid phrase, such as:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Emperiere des infernaux paluz,"</p>
</div></div>

<p>(a discovery of which he was so proud that he repeated it
elsewhere) or:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"sa tres chiere jeunesse."</p>
</div></div>

<p>And secondly the curiously processional effect of the metre
and of the construction of the stanzas--the extra line and
the extra foot lend themselves to a chaunt in their balanced
slow rhythm, as any one can find for himself by reading
the lines to some church sing-song as he goes.</p>

<h3>THE DEAD LORDS.</h3>



<p>As I have not wished to mix up smaller things with greater
I have put this <i>ballade</i> separate from that of "the Ladies,"
though it directly follows it as an after-thought in Villon's
own book. For the former is one of the masterpieces of
the world, and this, though very Villon, is not great.</p>

<p>What it has got is the full latter mediaeval love of odd
names and reminiscences, and also to the full, the humour
of the scholarly tavern, which was the "Mermaid" of that
generation: as the startling regret of:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>Hélas! et le bon roy d'Espaigne</p>
Duquel je ne sçay pas le nom....
</div></div>

<p>and the addition, after the false exit of "je me désiste"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>Encore fais une question</p>
</div></div>

<p>He laughed well over it, and was perhaps not thirsty
when it was written.</p>

<h3>THE DIRGE.</h3>



<p>This is the best ending for any set of verses one may choose
out of Villon. It follows and completes the epitaph which
in his will he orders to be written in charcoal--or scratched--above
his tomb: the sad, sardonic octave of "the little
scholar and poor." It is a kind of added dirge to be read
by those who pass and to be hummed or chaunted over
him dead. But it is a rondeau.</p>

<p>See how sharp it is with the salt and vinegar of his
pressed courageous smile--and how he cannot run away
from his religion or from his power over sudden and vivid
beauty.</p>

<p>"Sire--et clarté perpétuelle"--which last are the best
two words that ever stood in the vulgar for <i>lux perpetua</i>.</p>

<p>It is no wonder that as time went on, more and more
people learnt these things by heart.</p>

<h2>CLEMENT MAROT.</h2>
<br><br>

<p>If in Charles of Orleans the first note of the French Renaissance
is heard, if in Villon you find first its energy
appearing above ground, yet both are forerunners only.</p>

<p>With Marot one is in the full tide of the movement.
The discovery of America had preceded his birth by three
or perhaps four years. His early manhood was filled with
all that ferment, all that enormous branching out of human
life, which was connected with the expansion of Spain; he
was in the midst of the scarlet and the gold. A man just
of age when Luther was first condemned, living his active
manhood through the experience of the great battlefields
in Italy, wounded (a valet rather than a soldier) at Pavia,
the perpetual chorus of Francis I., privileged to witness
the first stroke of the pickaxe against the mediaeval Louvre,
and to see the first Italian dignity of the great stone houses
on the Loire--being all this, the Renaissance was the stuff
on which his life was worked.</p>

<p>His blood and descent were typical enough of the work
he had to do. His own father was one of the last set
rhymers of the dying Middle Ages. All his boyhood was
passed among that multitude of little dry "writers-down of
verse" with which, in Paris, the Middle Ages died; they
were not a swarm, for they were not living; they were a
heap of dust. All his early work is touched with the learned,
tedious, unbeautiful industry which was all that the elder
men round Louis XII could bring to letters. By a happy
accident there were mixed in him, however, two vigorous
springs of inspiration, each ready to receive the new forces
that were working in Europe, each destined to take the
fullest advantage of the new time. These springs were first,
learned Normandy, quiet, legal, well-founded, deep in grass,
wealthy; and secondly, the arid brilliancy of the South:
Quency and the country round Cahors. His father was a
Norman pure bred, who had come down and married into
that sharp land where the summer is the note of the whole
year, and where the traveller chiefly remembers vineyards,
lizards on the walls, short shadows, sleep at noon, and blinding
roads of dust. The first years of his childhood were
spent in the southern town, so that the south entered into
him thoroughly. The language that he never wrote, the
Languedoc, was that, perhaps, in which he thought during
all his life. It was his mother's.</p>

<p>It has been noticed by all his modern readers, it will be
noticed probably with peculiar force by English readers,
that the fame of Marot during his lifetime and his historical
position as the leader of the Renaissance has in it something
exaggerated and false. One cannot help a perpetual
doubt as to whether the religious quarrel, the influence of
the Court, the strong personal friendships and enmities
which surrounded him had not had more to do with his
reputation than his faculty, or even his genius, for rhyme.
Whenever he wanted £100 he asked it of the King
with the grave promise that he would bestow upon him
immortality.</p>

<p>From Ronsard, or from Du Bellay, we, here in the
north, could understand that phrase; from Marot it carries
a flavour of the grotesque. Ready song, indeed, and a great
power over the material one uses in singing last indefinitely;
they last as long as the sublime or the terrible in literature,
but we forbear to associate with them--perhaps unjustly--the
conception of greatness. If indeed anyone were to
maintain that Marot was not an excellent and admirable
poet he would prove himself ignorant of the language in
which Marot wrote, but let the most sympathetic turn to
what is best in his verse, let them turn for instance to that
charming lyric: "A sa Dame Malade" or to "The Ballad
of Old Time," or even to that really large and riotous chorus
of the vine, and they will see that it is the kind of thing
which is amplified by music, and which sometimes demands
the aid of music to appear at all. They will see quite
plainly that Marot took pleasure in playing with words and
arranged them well, felt keenly and happily, played a full
lyre, but they will doubt whether poetry was necessarily
for him the most serious business of life.</p>

<p>Why, then, has he taken the place claimed for him, and
why is he firmly secure in the place of master of the ceremonies,
as it were, to that glorious century whose dawn
he enjoyed and helped to beautify?</p>

<p>I will explain it.</p>

<p>It is because he is national. He represents not what is
most this, or most that--"highest," "noblest," "truest,"
"best," and all the rest of it--in his countrymen, but rather
what they have most in common.</p>

<p>Did you meet him to-day in the Strand you would know
at once that you had to do with a Frenchman, and, probably,
with a kind of poet.</p>

<p>He was short, square in the shoulders, tending in middle
age to fatness. A dark hair and beard; large brown eyes
of the south; a great, rounded, wrinkled forehead like
Verlaine's; a happy mouth, a nose very insignificant, completed
him. When we meet somewhere, under cypress trees
at last, these great poets of a better age, and find Ronsard
a very happy man, Du Bellay, a gentleman; then Malherbe,
for all that he was a northerner, we may mistake, if we find
him, for a Catalonian. Villon, however Parisian, will appear
the Bohemian that many cities have produced; Charles of
Orleans may seem at first but one of that very high nobility
remnants of which are still to be discovered in Europe.
But when we see Marot, our first thought will certainly be,
as I have said, that we have come across a Frenchman; and
the more French for a touch of the commonplace.</p>

<p>See how French was the whole career!</p>

<p>Whatever is new attracts him. The reformation attracts
him. It was <i>chic</i> to have to do with these new things. He
had the French ignorance of what was foreign and alien;
the French curiosity to meddle with it because it had come
from abroad; the French passion for opposing, for struggling;--and
beneath it all the large French indifference to
the problem of evil (or whatever you like to call it), the
changeless French content in certitude, upon which ease,
indeed, as upon a rock, the Church of Gaul has permanently
stood and will continuously repose.</p>

<p>He has been a sore puzzle to the men who have never
heard of these things. Calvin (that appalling exception
who had nothing in him of France except lucidity) could
make neither head nor tail of him. Geneva was glad enough
to chaunt through the nose his translations of the Psalms,
but it was woefully puzzled at his salacity, and the town
was very soon too hot to hold him in his exile. And as for
the common, partial, and ignorant histories of France,
written in our tongue, they generally make him a kind of
backslider, who might have been a Huguenot (and--who
knows?--have thrown the Sacrament to beasts with the
best of them) save that, unhappily, he did not persevere.
Whatever they say of him (and some have hardly heard
of him) one thing is quite certain: that they do not understand
him, and that if they did they would like him still
less than they do.</p>

<p>He was national in the rapidity of the gesture of his
mind as in that of his body: in his being attracted here and
there, watching this and that suddenly, like a bird.</p>

<p>He was national in his power of sharp recovery from
any emotion back into his normal balance.</p>

<p>He was national in that he depended upon companions,
and stood for a crowd, and deplored all isolation. He was
national in that he had nothing strenuous about him, and
that he was amiable, and if he had heard of "earnest" men,
he would have laughed at them a little, as people who did
not see the whole of life.</p>

<p>He was especially national (and it is here that the poet
returns) in that most national of all things--a complete
sympathy with the atmosphere of the native tongue. Thus
men debate a good deal upon the poetic value of Wordsworth,
but it is certain, when one sees how bathed he is in
the sense of English words, their harmony and balance,
that the man is entirely English, that no other nation could
have produced him, and that he will be most difficult for
foreigners to understand. You will not translate into French
or any other language the simplicity of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Glimpses that should make me less forlorn."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Nor can you translate, so as to give its own kind of grandeur</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>"Et arrivoit pour bénistre la vigne."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Apart from his place in letters, see how national he is in
what he does!</p>

<p>He buys two bits of land, he talks of them continually,
sees to them, visits them. They are quite little bits of land.
He calls one Clément, and the other Marot! Here is a
whimsicality you would not find, I think, among another
people.</p>

<p>He has the hatred of "sprawling" in his particular art
which is the chief aesthetic character of the French; but he
has the tendency to excess in opinion or in general expression
which is their chief political fault.</p>

<p>It is thus, then, that I think he should be regarded and
that I would desire to present him. It is thus, I am sure,
that he should be read if one is to know why he has taken
so great a place in the reverence and the history of the
French people.</p>

<p>And it is in this aspect that he may worthily introduce
much greater things, the Pléiade and Ronsard.</p>
<br><br>



<h3>OF COURTING LONG AGO.</h3>

<p class="mid">(<i><b>The Eighth of the Roundels.</b></i>)</p>



<p>This is a fair enough specimen of Marot at his daily gait:
an easy versifier "on a theme" and no more. I have said
that it is unjust to judge him on that level, and I have said
why; but I give this to give the man as he moved domestically
to the admiration of the court and of his friends in
a time which missed, for example, the epic character of the
last six lines of "Le Beau Tettin," and which hardly comprehended
of what value his pure lyric enthusiasms would
be to a sadder and drier posterity.</p>

<h3>NOËL.</h3>

<p class="mid">(<i><b>The Second of the Chansons.</b></i>)</p>



<p>But here, upon the contrary, is the spontaneity of his happy
mind; it suggests a song; one can hardly read it without
a tune in one's head, so simple is it and so purely lyrical:
there is a touch of the dance in it, too.</p>

<p>In these little things of Marot, which are neither learned
(and he boasted of learning) nor set and dry (and his
friends especially praised his precision), a great poet certainly
appears--in short revelations, but still appears. Unfortunately
there are not enough of them.</p>

<p>That he thought "like a Southerner," as I have maintained
and as I shall show by a further example, is made the
more probable from the value he lends to the feminine e.
The excellent rhythm of this poem you will only get by
giving the feminine e the value of a drawn out syllable:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i20">"L'effect</p>

</div></div>

<p>So Spaniards, Gascons, Provençaux, Italians, rhyme,
and all those of the south who have retained their glorious
"a's" and "o's".</p>

<p>As for the spirit of it--God bless him!--it is a subject
for perpetual merriment to think of such a man's being
taken for a true Huguenot and enmeshed, even for a while,
in the nasty cobweb of Geneva. But in the last thing I
shall quote, when he is Bacchic for the vine, you will see it
still more.</p>

<p>These two epigrams are again but examples of the readiness,
the wit, the hard surface of Marot, and they needed no
more poetry than was in Voltaire or Swift, but they needed
style. It was this absolute and standard style which his
contemporaries chiefly remarked in him: the marvel was,
that being mainly such an epigrammatist and scholar, and
praised and supported only in that guise, he should have
carried in him any, or rather so much, fire.</p>

<p>The first was his reply to a Dixaine the king's sister had

<p>It is the way this is printed that makes some miss its value.
It is, like all the best he wrote, a song; it needs the varying
time of human expression, the effect of tone, the repose
and the re-lifting of musical notes; illuminated thus it
greatly charmed, and if any one would know the order of
such a tune, why, it should follow the punctuation: a
cessation at the third line; a rise of rapid accents to the
thirteenth, and then a change; the last three lines of the
whole very much fuller and strong.</p>

<p>So I would hear it sung on a winter evening in an old
house in Auvergne, and re-enter the sixteenth century as
I heard.</p>

<h3>THE VINEYARD SONG.</h3>

<p class="mid">(<i><b>The 4th of the Chansons.</b></i>)</p>





<p>Here is Marot's best--even though many of his native
critics will not admit it so; but to feel it in full one must
be exiled from the vines.</p>

<p>It is a tapestry of the Renaissance; the jolly gods of
the Renaissance, the old gods grown Catholic moving
across a happier stage. Bacchus in long robes and with
solemnity blessing the vine, Silenus and the hobbling smith
who smithied the Serpe, the Holy Vineyard Knife in heaven,
all these by their diction and their flavour recall the Autumn
in Herault and the grapes under a pure sky, pale at the
horizon, and labourers and their carts in the vineyard, and
these set in the frame of that great time when Saturn did
return.</p>

<p>All the poem is wine. It catches its rhymes and weaves
them in and in, and moves rapid and careless in a fugue,
like the march from Asia when the Panthers went before
and drew the car. The internal rhythm and pulse is the
clapping of hands in barns at evening and the peasants'
feet dancing freely on the beaten earth. It is a very good
song; it remembers the treading of the grapes and is refreshed
by the mists that rise at evening when the labour
is done.</p>

<h2>RONSARD.</h2>

<p>If it be true that words create for themselves a special
atmosphere, and that their mere sound calls up vague outer
things beyond their strict meaning, so it is true that the
names of the great poets by their mere sound, by something
more than the recollection of their work, produce an atmosphere
corresponding to the quality of each; and the
name of Ronsard throws about itself like an aureole the
characters of fecundity, of leadership, and of fame.</p>

<p>A group of men to which allusion will be made in
connection with Du Bellay set out with a programme,
developed a determined school, and fixed the literary
renaissance of France at its highest point. They steeped
themselves in antiquity, and they put to the greatest value
it has ever received the name of poet; they demanded that
the poet should be a kind of king, or seer. Half seriously,
half as a product of mere scholarship, the pagan conception
of the muse and of inspiration filled them.</p>

<p>More than that; in their earnest, and, as it seemed at
first, artificial work, they formed the French language.
Some of its most famous and most familiar words proceed
from them--for instance, the word <i>Patrie</i>. Some few of
their exotic Greek and Latin adaptations were dropped;
the greater part remained. They have excluded from
French--as some think to the impoverishment of that
language--most elements of the Gothic--the inversion of
the adjective, the frequent suppression of the relative, the
irregularity of form, which had survived from the Middle
Ages, and which make the older French poetry so much
more sympathetic to the Englishman than is the new--all
these were destroyed by the group of men of whom I speak.
They were called by their contemporaries the Pleiade, for
they were seven stars.</p>

<p>Now, of these, Ronsard was easily the master. He had
that power which our anaemic age can hardly comprehend,
of writing, writing, writing, without fear of exhaustion,
without irritability or self-criticism, without danger of
comparing the better with the worse. Five great volumes
of small print, all good--men of that facility never write
the really paltry things--all good, and most of it glorious;
some of it on the level which only the great poets reach
here and there. It is in reading this man who rhymed unceasingly
for forty years, who made of poetry an occupation
as well as a glory, and who let it fill the whole of his life,
that one feels how much such creative power has to do with
the value of verse. There is a kind of good humility about
it, the humility of a man who does not look too closely at
himself, and the health of a soul at full stride, going
forward. You may open Ronsard at any page, and find a
beauty; you may open any one of the sonnets at random,
and in translating it discover that you are compelled to a
fine English, because he is saying, plainly, great things.
And of these sonnets, note you, he would write thirty at
a stretch, and then twenty, and then a second book, with
seventy more. So that as one reads one cannot help understanding
that Italian who said a man was no poet unless
he could rap out a century of sonnets from time to time;
and one is reminded of the general vigour of the age and
of the way in which art of all sorts was mingled up together,
when one remembers the tags of verses, just such verses as
these, which are yet to be seen in our galleries set down
doubtfully on the margin of their sketches by the great
artists of Italy.</p>

<p>Ronsard, with these qualities of a leader, unconscious,
as all true leaders are, of the causes of his leadership, and
caring, as all true leaders do, for nothing in leadership save
the glory it brings with it, had also, as have all leaders,
chiefly the power of drawing in a multitude of friends.
The peculiar head of his own group, he very soon became
the head of all the movement of his day. He had made
letters really great in the minds of his contemporaries, and
having so made them, appeared before them as a master of
those letters. Certainly, as I shall quote him in a moment
when I come to his dying speech, he was "satiated with
glory."</p>

<p>Yet this man did not in his personality convey that
largeness which was his principal mark. His face was
narrow, long and aquiline; his health uneven. It was
evidently his soul which made men quickly forget the ill-matched
case which bore it; for almost alone of the great
poets he was consistently happy, and there poured out from
him not only this unceasing torrent of verse, but also
advice, sustenance, and a kind of secondary inspiration for
others.</p>

<p>In yet another matter he was a leader, and a leader of
the utmost weight, not the cause, perhaps, but certainly
the principal example of the trend which the mind of the
nation was taking as the sixteenth century drew to a close.
I mean in the matter of religion, upon whose colour every
society depends, which is the note even of a national language,
and which seems to be the ultimate influence beyond
which no historical analysis can carry a thinking man.</p>

<p>But even those who will not admit the truth of this
should watch the theory closely, for with the religious
trend of France is certainly bound up, and, as I would
maintain, on such an influence is dependent, that ultimate
setting of the French classic, that winding up of the
Renaissance, with which I shall deal in the essay upon
Malherbe.</p>

<p>The stream of Catholicism was running true. The nation
was tumbling back after a high and turbulent flood into
the channel it had scoured for itself by the unbroken
energies of a thousand years. It is no accident that Ronsard,
that Du Bellay, were churchmen. It is a type. It is a type
of the truth that the cloth admitted poets; of the truth that
in the great battle whose results yet trouble Europe, here,
on the soil where the great questions are fought out,
Puritanism was already killed. The epicurean in them both,
glad and ready in Ronsard, sombre and Lucretian in Du
Bellay, jarred indeed in youth against their vows; but that
it should have been tolerated, that it should have led to no
excess or angry revolt, was typical of their moment. It
was typical, finally, of their generation that all this mixture
of the Renaissance with the Church matured at last into its
natural fruit, for in the case of Ronsard we have a noble
expression of perfect Christianity at the end.</p>

<p>In the November of 1585 he felt death upon him; he
had himself borne to his home as soon as the Huguenot
bands had left it, ravaged and devastated as it was. He
found it burnt and looted, but it reminded him of childhood
and of the first springs of his great river of verse. A
profound sadness took him. He was but in his sixty-second
year, his mind had not felt any chill of age. He could not
sleep; poppies and soporifics failed him. He went now in
his coach, now on a litter from place to place in that
country side which he had rendered famous, and saw the
Vendomois for the last time; its cornfields all stubble under
a cold and dreary sky. And in each place he waited for a
while.</p>

<p>But death troubled him, and he could not remain. Within
a fortnight he ordered that they should carry him southward
to the Loire, to that priory of which--by a custom of
privilege, nobility and royal favour--he was the nominal
head, the priory which is "the eye and delight of Touraine",--the
Isle of St. Cosmo. He sickened as he went. The
thirty miles or so took him three painful days; twice, all
his strength failed him, and he lay half fainting in his
carriage; to so much energy and to so much power of
creation these episodes were an awful introduction of death.</p>

<p>It was upon the 17th of November that he reached the
walls wherein he was Superior; six weeks later, on the
second day after Christmas, he died.</p>

<p>Were I to describe that scene to which he called the
monks, all men of his own birth and training, were I to
dwell upon the appearance and the character of the oldest
and the wisest, who was also the most famous there, I should
extend this essay beyond its true limit, as I should also do
were I to write down, even briefly, the account of his just,
resigned, and holy death. It must suffice that I transcribe
the chief of his last deeds; I mean, that declaration wherein
he made his last profession of faith.</p>

<p>The old monk had said to him: "In what resolution do
you die?"</p>

<p>He answered, somewhat angrily: "In what did you
think? In the religion which was my father's and his
father's, and his father's and his father's before him--for
I am of that kind."</p>

<p>Then he called all the community round him, as though
the monastic simplicity had returned (so vital is the Faith,
so simple its primal energies), and as though he had been
the true prior of some early and fervent house, he told
them these things which I will faithfully translate on
account of their beauty. They are printed here, I think, for
the first time in English, and must stand for the end of
this essay:</p>

<p>He said: "That he had sinned like other men, and,
perhaps, more than most; that his senses had led him away
by their charm, and that he had not repressed or constrained
them as he should; but none the less, he had always held
that Faith which the men of his line had left him, he had
always clasped close the Creed and the unity of the Catholic
Church; that, in fine, he had laid a sure foundation, but
he had built thereon with wood, with hay, with straw. As
for that foundation, he was sure it would stand; as for the
light and worthless things he had built upon it he had trust
in the mercy of the Saviour that they would be burnt in
the fire of His love. And now he begged them all to
believe hard, as he had believed; but not to live as he had
lived; they must understand that he had never attempted
or plotted against the life or goods of another, nor ever
against any man's honour, but, after all, there was nothing
therein wherewith to glorify one's self before God." When
he had wept a little, he continued, saying, "that the world
was a ceaseless turmoil and torment, and shipwreck after
shipwreck all the while, and a whirlpool of sins, and tears
and pain, and that to all these misfortunes there was but
one port, and this port was Death. But, as for him, he
carried with him into that port no desire and no regret for
life. That he had tried every one of its pretended joys, that
he had left nothing undone which could give him the least
shadow of pleasure or content, but that at the end he had
found everywhere the oracle of Wisdom, vanity of vanities."</p>

<p>He ended with this magnificent thing, which is, perhaps,
the last his human power conceived, and I will put it down
in his own words:--</p>

<p>"Of all those vanities, the loveliest and most praiseworthy
is glory--fame. No one of my time has been so
filled with it as I; I have lived in it, and loved and triumphed
in it through time past, and now I leave it to my
country to garner and possess it after I shall die. So do I
go away from my own place as satiated with the glory of
this world as I am hungry and all longing for that of God."</p>
<br>

<h3>DIALOGUE WITH THE NINE SISTERS.</h3>



<p>This is a little Amaboean thing not very well known but
very Horatian and worth setting down here because it is
in the manner of so much that he wrote.</p>

<p>Its manner is admirable. Its gentleness, persistency and
increase--are like those of his own small river the Loir.
Its last stanza from the middle of the first line "<i>Ceux dont
la fantaisie</i>" to the end, should, I think be famous; but
an English reader can hardly forgive such an introduction
as "<i>Voilà sagement dit</i>" to so noble a finale.</p>

<h3>THE EPITAPH ON RABELAIS.</h3>



<p>Seven years after Rabelais died, Ronsard wrote this off-hand.
I give it, not for its value, but because it connects
these two great names. The man who wrote it had seen
that large and honorable mouth worshipping wine: he had
reverenced that head of laughter which has corrected all
our philosophy. It would be a shame to pass such a name
as Ronsard's signed to an epitaph on such a work as that
of Rabelais, poetry or no poetry.</p>

<p>Ronsard also from a tower at Meudon used to creep out
at night and drink with that fellow-priest, vicar of the
Parish, Rabelais: a greater man than he.</p>

<p>By a memory separate from the rest of his verse, Ronsard
was moved to write this Rabelaisian thing. For he had
seen him "full length upon the grass and singing so."</p>

<p>There is no need of notes, for these great names of
Gargantua, Panurge and Friar John are household to every
honest man.</p>

<h3>"MIGNONNE ALLONS VOIR SI LA ROSE."</h3>

<p class="mid">(<i><b>The 17th Ode of the First Book.</b></i>)</p>



<p>"In these eighteen lines," says very modernly a principal
critic, "lies Ronsard's fame more surely than in all the remaining
mass of his works." He condemns by implication
Ronsard's wide waste of power; but the few other poems
that I have here had room to print, should make the reader
careful of such judgements. It is true that in the great
hoard which Ronsard left his people there are separate and
particular jewels set in the copper and the gold, but the
jewels are very numerous: indeed it was almost impossible
to choose so few as I have printed here.</p>

<p>If it be asked why this should have become the most
famous, no answer can be given save the "flavour of language."
It is the perfection of his tongue. Its rhythm
reaches the exact limit of change which a simple metre will
tolerate: where it saddens, a lengthy hesitation at the opening
of the seventh line introduces a new cadence, a lengthy
lingering upon the last syllables of the tenth, eleventh and
twelfth closes a grave complaint. So, also by an effect of
quantities, the last six lines rise out of melancholy into their
proper character of appeal and vivacity: an exhortation.</p>

<p>Certainly those who are so unfamiliar with French poetry
as not to know that its whole power depends upon an extreme
subtlety of rhythm, may find here the principal example
of the quality they have missed. Something much
less weighty than the stress of English lines, a just perceptible
difference between nearly equal syllables, marks the
excellent from the intolerable in French prosody: and to
feel this truth in the eighteen lines that follow it is necessary
to read them virtually in the modern manner--for the "s"
in "vesprée" or "vostre" were pedantries in the sixteenth
century--but one must give the mute "e's" throughout
as full a value as they have in singing. Indeed, reading
this poem, one sees how it must have been composed to
some good and simple air in the man's head.</p>

<p>If the limits of a page permitted it, I would also show
how worthy the thing was of fame from its pure and careful
choice of verb--"Tandis que vostre age <i>fleuronne</i>"--but
space prevents me, luckily, for all this is like splitting a
diamond.</p>

<h3>THE "SONNETS FOR HÉLÈNE"</h3>

<p class="mid">(<i><b>The 42nd and 43rd Sonnets of the Second Book.</b></i>)</p>



<p>Hélène was very real. A young Maid of Honour to Catherine
de Medicis; Spanish by blood, Italian by breeding,
called in France "de Sugères," she was the gravest and the
wisest, and, for those who loved serenity, the most beautiful
of that high and brilliant school.</p>

<p>The Sonnets began as a task; a task the Queen had set
Ronsard, with Hélène for theme: they ended in the last
strong love of Ronsard's life. A sincere lover of many
women, he had come to the turn of his age when he saw
her, like a memory of his own youth. He has permitted
to run through this series, therefore, something of the
unique illusion which distance in time or space can lend
to the aspect of beauty. An emotion so tenuous does not
appear in any other part of his work: here alone you find
the chastity or weakness which made something in his
mind come near to the sadder Du Bellay's: his soul is regardant
all the while as he writes: visions rise from her
such as never rose from Cassandra; as this great picture at
the opening of the 58th Sonnet of the Second Book:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>Seule sans compagnie en une grande salle</p>
<p>Tu logeois l'autre jour pleine de majesté.</p>
</div></div>

<p>These "Sonnets for Hélène" should be common knowledge:
they are (with Du Bellay's) the evident original upon which
the author of Shakespeare's Sonnets modelled his work:
they are the late and careful effort of Ronsard's somewhat
spendthrift genius.</p>

<p>Here are two of them. One, the second, most famous,
the other, the first, hardly known: both are admirable.</p>

<p>It is the perfection of their sound which gives them their
peculiar quality. The very first lines lead off with a completed
harmony: it is as thoroughly a winter night as that
in Shakespeare's song, but it is more solemn and, as it were,
more "built of stone...." "La Lune Ocieuse, tourne si
lentement son char tout à l'entour," is like a sleeping
statue of marble.</p>

<p>To this character, the second adds a vivid interest of
emotion which has given it its special fame. Even the
populace have come to hear of this sonnet, and it is sung to
a lovely tune. It has also what often leads to permanent
reputation in verse, a great simplicity of form. The Sextet
is well divided from the Octave, the climax is clearly underlined.
Ronsard was often (to his hurt) too scholarly to
achieve simplicity: when, under the clear influence of some
sharp passion or gaiety he did achieve it, then he wrote
the lines that will always remain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>A fin qu'à tout jamais de siècle en siècle vive,</p>
<p>La Parfaicte amitié que Ronsard la portait.</p>

<h2>JOACHIM DU BELLAY.</h2>

<p>
In Du Bellay the literary Renaissance, French but transfigured
by Italy, middle-north of the plains but looking
southward to the Mediterranean, came to one soul and
concentrated upon it, as the plastic expression of the same
influence concentrated in Goujon. Very central in time,
half soldier, half priest, all student; traveller and almost
adventurer, a pilgrim throughout of the Idea, everything
about him is symbolic of the generation he adorned.</p>

<p>In its vigour, at least, the Renaissance was a glorious
youth--he, Du Bellay, died at thirty-five. Its leap and
soaring were taken from the firm platform of strong
scholarship--he was a scholar beyond the rest. It fixed
special forms--he the French sonnet. It felt the lives of all
things running through it as a young man feels them in the
spring woods--he gathered in the cup of his verse, and retains
for us, the nerve of all that life which is still exultant in the
forest beyond his river. His breeding, his high name, his
leisured poverty, his passionate friendship, his looking forward
always to a new thing, a creation--all this, was the
Renaissance in person.</p>

<p>Moreover, the Renaissance had in France its seat where,
between rolling lands whose woods are the walls of gardens,
the broad and shallow inland Loire runs from Orleans, past
Blois and Tours and Saumur, and Ancenis, until near
Nantes at last it feels the tide: salt and adventures and the
barbaric sea. This varied sheltered land of aged vineyards
and great wealth has, for the French Renaissance, the one
special quality of beginnings and Edens, namely, that it
preserves on to a later time the outward evidences of an
original perfection. This place, the nest or seed-plot of the
new civilisation, still shows its castles--Blois, Amboise,
Chambord. Here Leonardo died, Rabelais, Ronsard himself
was born. Here the kings of the Change built in their
fantastic pride, and founded a France that still endures.
It is as truly the soil of the modern thing as are the
provinces north of it (the Isle de France, Normandy,
Picardy and Champagne), the soil of the earlier mediaeval
flower, and of the Gothic which they preserve unique to
our own time.</p>

<p>Now, of this district, Du Bellay was more than a native;
he was part of it; he pined away from it; he regretted, as
no other man of the time regretted, his father's land:
Anjou and the fields of home. He may be said, with some
exaggeration, to have died in the misfortune of his separation
from the security and sober tradition of his own walls.
That great early experience of his, which I have already
written down--his meeting with Ronsard--had come to
him not far from his own hill, south of the great river.
His name, unlike Ronsard's, recalled the gentry of that
countryside up to and beyond the beginning of its history;
alone of the Pleiade he translated the valley of the Loire,
its depth, its delicacy, its rich and subtle loneliness.</p>

<p>Again, the Renaissance lived in France an inspired and
an exalted life, so that there necessarily ran through it a
fore-knowledge of sudden ending. This tragedy repeated
itself in the career of Du Bellay.</p>

<p>His name was famous. The three Du Bellays, the
councillor, the soldier, the great Cardinal, were in the first
rank of the early sixteenth century. Rabelais had loved
them. Francis I had leaned upon and rewarded their
service. His father (their first-cousin and Governor of
Brest) was a poor noble, who, as is the fashion of nobles,
had married a wife to consolidate a fortune. This wife, the
mother of Joachim, was heiress to the house of Tourmélière
in Liré, just by the Loire on the brow that looks northward
over the river to the bridge and Ancenis. In this
house he was born. On his parents' early death he inherited
the place, not to enjoy it, but to wander. An early illness
had made him forsake the career of arms for that of the
Church; but Orders were hardly so much as a cloak to him;
it is difficult to remember, as one reads the few evidences
of his life, that he wore the cloth at all: in his verse all trace
of it is entirely absent. He lived still in that lineage which
the reform had not touched. The passionate defence of the
Catholic Faith, the Assault converging on the church
throughout Europe, the raising of the Siege, the Triumph
which developed, at last, on the political side the League,
and on the literary the final rigidity of Malherbe, the noise
of all these had not reached his circle, kind, or family.</p>

<p>Of that family the Cardinal seems to have regarded him
as the principal survivor. He had determined to make of
the young poet the heir of its glory. It came to nothing.
He accompanied his relative to Rome: but the diplomacy
of the mission ill-suited him. Of the Royal ladies at court
who befriended him, the marriage of one, the death of
another, increased his insecurity. He had inherited, to his
bane, another estate--Gonor--from his elder brother. It
was encumbered, the cause litigious, and he had inherited
with it the tutelage of a sickly child. He never shook off
the burden. A tragic error marked his end. He died,
certainly broken-hearted, just when his powerful cousin,
by a conversion perhaps unknown to the poet himself, had
rejected calumnies, and had determined to resign to him
the great Archbishopric of Bordeaux.</p>

<p>Eustache Du Bellay, yet another cousin, was Bishop of
Paris. He had made Joachim, on his return from Rome,
a Canon of Notre Dame, and in that capacity the poet,
dying in Paris, was buried in the cathedral. The action of
the Chapter in the eighteenth century, when they replaced
the old tombstones by the present pavement, has destroyed
the record of his grave; I believe it to lie in the southern
part of the ambulatory.</p>

<p>In this abrupt descent, following upon so fierce an activity
of thought, he prefigured, I say, the close of the Renaissance
as his genius typified its living spirit; for all the while, as
you read him, you see the cloud about his head, and the
profound, though proud and constant, sadness of his eyes.</p>

<p>This, also, was pure Renaissance in him, that the fields
in which he wandered, and which he loved to sing--a man
of elegies--were dominated by the awful ruins of Rome.
These it was that lent him his gravity, and perhaps oppressed
him. He sang them also with a comprehension of
the superb.</p>

<p>He was second to Ronsard. Though he was the sharp
voice of the Pleiade, though it was he who published their
famous manifesto, though his scholarship was harder,
though his energy could run more fiercely to one point and
shine there more brilliantly in one small climax; yet he was
second. He himself thought it of himself, and called himself
a disciple. All up and down his works you find an
astonished admiration directed towards his greater friend--</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i14">                   ... Un amy que les Dieux</p>
<p>Guydent si hault au sentier des plus vieux.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Or again--</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>Divin Ronsard qui de l'arc a sept cordes</p>
<p>Tiras premier au but de la mémoire</p>
<p>Les traicts ailez de la Françoise gloire.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Everywhere it is his friend rather than he that has touched
the mark of the gods and called up from the tomb the ghost
of Rome which all that company worshipped.</p>

<p>I say he saw himself that he was second. Old Durat
saw it clearly in that little college of poets where he taught
the unteachable thing: De Baif, Belleau--all the comrades
would have taken it for granted. Ronsard led and was
chief, because he had the firm largeness, the laughter and
the permanence which are the marks of those who determine
the fortunes of the French in letters or in arms. Ronsard
made. His verses, in their great mass and unfailing level,
were but one example of the power that could produce a
school, call up a general enthusiasm, and for forty years
govern the taste of his country. There was in him something
public, in Du Bellay something domestic and attached,
as in the relations of a king and of a herald. Or again, the
one was like an ordered wood with a rich open plain about
it, the other was like a garden. Ronsard was the Beauce;
Du Bellay was Anjou. It might be said of the first that
he stood a symbol for the wheat and corn-land of the
Vendômois, and of the second, that he recalled that subtle
wine of the southern Loire to which Chinon gives the most
famous label.</p>

<p>Du Bellay was second: nevertheless, when he is well
known in this country it will be difficult to convince Englishmen
of that truth. There is in his mind a facet which exactly
corresponds to a facet of our own, and that is a quality
so rare in the French classics that it will necessarily attract
English readers to him: for, of all people, we nowadays
criticise most in letters by the standard of our immediate
emotions, and least by what was once called "reason." He
was capable of that which will always be called "poignancy,"
and what for the moment we call "depth." He was less
careful than are the majority of his countrymen to make
letters an art, and so to treat his own personality as a thing
apart. On the contrary, he allowed that personality to
pierce through continually, so that simplicity, directness, a
certain individual note as of a human being complaining--a
note we know very well in our own literature--is perpetually
discovered.</p>

<p>Thus, in a spirit which all Englishmen will understand,
a lightness almost sardonic lay above the depths of his
grief, and the tenderness which attached to his home played
around the things that go with quietude--his books and
animals. I shall quote hereafter the epitaphs he wrote for
his dog and for his cat, this singer of sublime and ruined
things.</p>

<p>Of the dog who--</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">     ... allait tousjours suivant</p>
<p>Quelquefois allait devant.</p>
<p>Faisant ne sçay quelle feste</p>
<p>D'un gai branslement de teste.</p>
</div></div>

<p>and of whom he says, in a pretty imitation of Catullus,
that he--</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i4">... maintenant pourmeine</p>
<p>Parmy cette ombreuse plaine</p>
<p>Dont nul ne revient vers nous.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Or of the cat who was--</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">  ... par aventure</p>
<p>Le plus bel oeuvre que nature</p>
<p>Fit onc en matière de chats.</p>
</div></div>

<p>All that delicate side of him we understand very well.</p>

<p>Nor is it to modern Englishmen alone that he will appeal.
He powerfully affected, it may be presumed, the English
Renaissance which succeeded him. Spenser--thirty years
after his death--was moved to the translation of his famous
lament for Rome, and no one can read the sonnets to which
he gave their final form without catching the same note in
the great English cycle of the generation after him--the
close of the sixteenth and the opening of the seventeenth
centuries.</p>

<p>But his verse read will prove all this and suggest much
more.</p>

<br><br>

<h3>EXTRACTS FROM THE "ANTIQUITEZ
DE ROME."</h3>



<p>Of the high series which Rome called forth from Du
Bellay during that bitter diplomatic exile of his, I have
chosen these three sonnets, because they seem best to express
the majesty and gloom which haunted him. It is
difficult to choose in a chain of cadences so equal and so
exalted, but perhaps the last, "Telle que dans son char la
Berecynthienne" is the most marvellous. The vision alone
of Rome like the mother of the Gods in her car would have
made the sonnet immortal. He adds to the mere picture a
noise of words that is like thunder in the hills far off on
summer afternoons: the words roll and crest themselves
and follow rumbling to the end: he could not have known
as he wrote it how great a thing he was writing. It has
all the character of verse that increases with time and seems
superior to its own author's intention.</p>

<h3>THE SONNET OF EXILE.</h3>

<p>This sonnet dates from the same period at Rome, or possibly
from his return. It has a different note. It is the
most personal and passionate of all his writings, in which
so much was inspired by personal regret. On this account
it has a special literary interest as the most <i>modern</i> thing
of the Renaissance. It would be far less surprising to find
this written by one of the young republicans under the
Second Empire (for instance) than to find a couplet of
Malherbe's straying into our time.</p>

<h3>THE SONNET "HEUREUX QUI COMME
ULYSSE."</h3>

<p class="mid">(<i><b>The 31st of the "Regrets."</b></i>)</p>



<p>It was of a large gray house, moated, a town beside it, yet
not far from woods and standing in rough fields, pure Angevin,
Tourmélière, the Manor house of Liré, his home,
that Du Bellay wrote this, the most dignified and perhaps
the last of his sonnets. The sadness which is the permanent,
though sometimes the unrecognized, moderator of his race,
which had pierced through in his latter misfortunes, and
which had tortured him to the cry that has been printed
on the preceding page, here reached a final and a most
noble form: something much higher than melancholy, and
more majestic than regret. He turned to his estate, the
mould of his family, a roof, the inheritance of which had
formed his original burden and had at last crushed him;
but he turned to it with affection. If one may use so small
a word in connection with a great poet, the gentleman in
him remembered an ancestral repose.</p>

<p>There is very much in the Sonnet to mark that development
of French verse in which Du Bellay played so great
a part. The inversion of the sentence, a trick which gives
a special character to all the later formal drama is prominent:
the convention of contrast, the purely classical allusion,
are mixed with a spirit that is still spontaneous and
even naïf. But every word is chosen, and it is especially
noteworthy to discover so early that restraint in epithet
which is the charm but also the danger of what French style
has since become. Of this there are two examples here:
the eleventh line and the last, which rhymes with it. To
contrast slate with marble would be impossible prose save
for the exact adjective "<i>fine</i>," which puts you at once into
Anjou. The last line, in spite of its exquisite murmur,
would be grotesque if the "<i>air marin</i>" were meant for the
sea-shore. Coming as it does after the suggestions of the
Octave it gives you suddenly sea-faring: Ulysses, Jason,
his own voyages, the long way to Rome, which he knew;
and in the "<i>douceur Angevine</i>" you have for a final foil to
such wanderings, not only in the meaning of the words, but
in their very sound, the hearth and the return.</p>

<h3>THE WINNOWER'S HYMN TO THE
WINDS.</h3>



<p>This delicate air of summer, this reminiscence and comfort
for men who no longer see the Eure or the Bievre or any
of their northern rivers, this very mirror of Du Bellay's
own exiled mind--was written for an "exercise." It is a
translation--a translation from the Latin of a forgotten
Venetian scholar.</p>

<p>When a man finds in reading such a startling truth, it
convinces him that letters have a power of their own and
are greater of themselves than the things which inspired
them: for when, to show his skill in rendering Latin into
French verse, Du Bellay had written this down, he created
and fixed for everybody who was to read him from then
onwards the permanent picture of a field by the side of a
small, full river, with a band of trees far off, and, above, the
poplar leaves that are never still. It runs to a kind of
happy croon, and has for a few moments restored very
many who have read it to their own place; and Corot
should have painted it.</p>

<h3>THE FUNERAL ODES OF THE DOG
AND THE CAT.</h3>

<p>Here are extracts from those two delightful and tender
things to which allusion has already been made. The epitaphs
upon his little dog and his little cat.</p>

<p>It was a character in this sad man to make little, humble,
grotesque, pleasing images of grief; as it were, little idols
of his goddess; and he fashioned them with an exquisite
humour and affection. What animal of the sixteenth century
lives so clearly as these two? None, I think, except
some few in the pictures of the painters of the low countries.</p>

<p>I wish I had space to print both these threnodies in full,
but they are somewhat long, and I must beg my reader to
find them in the printed works of Du Bellay. It is well
worth the pains of looking.</p>

<h2>MALHERBE.</h2>

<p>The French Renaissance ended in the Classic. The fate
of all that exuberance was to find order, and that chaos of
generation settled down to the obedience of unchanging
laws. This transition, which fixed, perhaps for ever, the
nature of the French tongue, is bound up with the name of
Malherbe.</p>

<p>When what the French have entitled "the great time,"
when the generation of Louis XIV looked back to find
an origin for its majestic security in letters, it was in
Malherbe that such an origin was discovered; he had
tamed the wildness of the Renaissance, he had bent its
vigour to an arrangement and a frame; by him first were
explicitly declared those rules within which all his successors
were content to be narrowed. The devotion to his
memory is nowhere more exalted or more typically presented
than in the famous cry--<i>enfin Malherbe vint</i>. His
name carried with it a note of completion and of an end.</p>

<p>When the romantic revival of our own time sought for
one mind on which to lay the burden of its anger, one
hard master or pedant who could be made responsible for
the drying up of the wells, Malherbe again was found.
He became the butt of Hugo's splendid ridicule. He was
the god of plaster that could not hear or speak or feel, but
which fools had worshipped; a god easy to break to pieces.
His austerity--for them without fullness--his meagre
output, his solemn reiterated code of "perfect taste,"
moved them to a facile but intense aggression. He it was
that had turned to fossil stone the living matter of the
sixteenth century: He that had stifled and killed the spirit
they attempted to recall.</p>

<p>This man so praised, so blamed, for such a quality, was
yet exactly, year for year, the contemporary of Shakespeare,
born earlier and dying later. No better example could be
discovered of the contrast between the French and English
tempers.</p>

<p>The Romantics, I say, believed that they had destroyed
Malherbe and left the Classic a ruined, antiquated thing.
They were in error. Victor Hugo himself, the leader, who
most believed the classic to have become isolated and past,
was yet, in spite of himself, constrained by it. Lamartine
lived in it. After all the fantastic vagaries of mystics and
realists and the rest, it is ruling to-day with increasing
power, returning as indeed the permanent religion, the
permanent policy, of the nation are also returning after a
century of astounding adventures: for the Classic has in
it something necessary to the character of the French
people.</p>

<p>Consider what the Classic is and why all mighty civilisations
have demanded and obtained some such hard, permanent
and, as it were, sacred vehicle for the expression
of their maturity.</p>

<p>Nations that have a long continuous memory of their
own past, nations especially whose gods have suffered
transformation, but never death, develop the somewhat
unelastic wisdom of men in old age. They mistrust the
taste of the moment. They know that things quite fresh
and violent seem at first greater than they are: that such
enthusiasm forms no lasting legacy for posterity. Their
very ancient tradition gives them a thirst for whatever
shall certainly remain. The rigid Classic satisfies that need.</p>

<p>Again, you will discover that those whose energy is too
abundant seek for themselves by an instinct the necessary
confines without which such energy is wasted--and wasted
the more from its excess. They canalise for their own security
a torrent which, undisciplined, would serve but to
destroy. Such an instinct is apparent in every department
of French life. To their jurisprudence the French have
ever attempted to attach a code, to their politics the stone
walls of a Constitution, or, at the least, of a fundamental
theory. Their theology from Athanasius through St. Germanus
to the modern strict defence against all "liberals"
has glorified the unchanging. Every outburst of the interior
fires in the history of Gaul has been followed by a
rapid, plastic action which reduced to human use what
might otherwise have crystallised into an amorphous lava.
So the wild freedom of the twelfth century was captured
to form the Monarchy, the University, the full Gothic
of the thirteenth: so the Revolution permitted Napoleon
and produced, not the visionary unstable grandeur of the
Gironde, but the schools and laws and roads and set government
we see to-day. So the spring storms of the Renaissance
settled, I say, into that steady summer of stable form
which has now for three hundred years dominated the
literature of the country.</p>

<p>Caught on with this aspect of energy producing the
Classic is the truth that energy alone can dare to be classical.
Where the great currents of the soul run feebly a perpetual
acceleration, whether by novelty or by extravagance, will
be demanded; where they run full and heavy, then, under
the restraint of form, they will but run more proudly and
more strong. It is the flickering of life that fears hard rules
in verse and may not feel the level classics of our Europe.
Their rigidity is not that of marble; they are not dead.
A human acquaintance with their sobriety soon fills us as we
read. If we lie in the way of the giants who conceived them
(let me say Corneille or the great Dryden), re-reading and
further knowledge--especially a deeper experience of common
life about us--reveal to us the steadfast life of these
images; the eyes open, the lips might almost move; the
statue descends and lives.</p>

<p>The man who imposed design and authority and unity
upon the letters of his country, and who so closed the
epoch with which I have been dealing, was singularly
suited to his task. Observant, something of a stoic, uninspired;
courageous, witty, a soldier; lucid, critical of method
only, he corresponded to the movement which, all around
him, was ushering in the Bourbons: the hardening of
Goujon's and de l'Orme's luxuriance into the conventions
of the great colonnades and the sombre immensity of the
new palaces; the return of one national faith to a people
weary of so many random quarrels; the mistrust of an ill-ordered
squirearchy; the firm founding of a central government.</p>

<p>He was Norman. Right of that north whence the vigour,
though not the inspiration, of the Renaissance had proceeded,
and into which it returned. Caen gave him birth,
and still remembers him. Normans still edit his works--and
dedicate these books to the town which also bred
Corneille. Norman, learned with that restrained but
vigorous learning of the province, he was also of the
province in his blood, for he came of one of those fixed
families whose heads held great estates all round Falaise,
and whose cadets branched off into chances abroad: one of
the Boughtons, in Kent, is still "Boughton Malherbe."[1]</p>

<p>[Footnote 1: Not from the Conquest. It is near Charing, originally
de Braose land, but an heiress married a Malherbe in the early
twelfth century.]</p>

<p>He was poor. His father, who held one of those magistracies
which the smaller nobility bought or inherited, had
not known where to turn in the turmoil of the central
century. In a moment of distress he called himself
Huguenot when that party seemed to triumph, and Malherbe
in anger against the apostasy went down south, a boy
of nineteen, and fought as a soldier--but chiefly duels;
for he loved that sport. He lay under a kind of protection
from the great Catholic houses, though still poor, till in
1601--he was a man of forty-six--Henri IV heard of
him. In all these years he had worked at the rule of poetry
like an artisan, thinking of nothing else, not even of fame.
Those who surrounded him took it for granted that he
was a master critic--a sort of judge without appeal, but
it was a very little provincial circle surrounding a very unimportant
house in Provence. Thus, careless it seems of
everything except that "form of language" which was
with him a passion, like the academic or theological passions,
he was astonished on coming to Paris in 1605 to
discover how suited such a pre-occupation was to such a
time, and how rapidly he became the first name in contemporary
letters. Of men who poured out verse the age was
satiated; of men who could seize the language at this turn
in its fortune, fix it and give it rules, the age had no
knowledge till he came: the age fastened upon him, and
insisted upon making him a master.</p>

<p>A full twenty years from 1607 he governed the transformation,
not of thought, for that he little changed, but
of method and of expression. He decided what should be
called the typical metres, the alternative of feminine and
masculine in verse, the order of emphasis, the proportion
of inversion tolerable, the propriety, the modernity, the
archaism of words. It is a function to our time meaningless
and futile: to such a period as that, indispensable and
even noble. He interpreted and published the national
sentiment upon this major thing, the architecture of letters.
The power of his mind, tortured and insufficient in actual
production, was supreme in putting forth clearly and finally
that criticism which ran as an unspoken and obscure current
of opinion in the mind of his age. This was his glory,
and it was true.</p>

<p>His dryness was extraordinary. In a life of seventy-two
years, during which he wrote and erased incessantly, he,
the poet, wrote just so much verse as will fill in large type
a little pocket volume of 250 pages; to be accurate, forty-three
lines a year. Of this scraping and pumice stone in the
mind a better example than his verse is to be found in his
letters. A number remain. They might seem to be written
by two different men! Half a dozen are models of that
language he adored--they cost him, to our knowledge,
many days--the rest are slipshod notes that any man might
write, for he thought they would not survive, and, indeed,
the majority of his editors have had the piety to suppress
them.</p>

<p>No one will understand Malherbe who only hears of
how, like a dusty workman, he cut and polished, and so
fixed the new jewel of letters. In our less happy age the
academic spirit is necessarily associated with a lethargic
stupidity. In his it was not so. His force, by which this
work was carried through, lay in a character of penetration.
His face expresses it. His very keen and ready eyes, his
high lifted brow, his sharp nose, and the few active lines of
his cheek and forehead, the poise of his head, the disdain
of his firm mouth, all build him back alive for us. His talk,
which stammered in its volubility, was incessant and varied;
his temper ready; his bodily command of gesture and definition
perfect in old age: he was of good metal all those
years.</p>

<p>Of his intense Toryism, his vivacity, his love of arms,
his tenacity of perception, Racan gives us in his biography
an admirable picture. Just before he died his son was killed
in a duel--he, at seventy-two, desired passionately to kill
the adversary. "Gambling," he said, "my pence of life
against the gold of his twenty-five years." He had wit,
and he hated well--hating men after death:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>Here richly with ridiculous display</p>
<p>Killed by excess was Wormwood laid away,</p>
<p>While all of his acquaintance sneered and slanged,</p>
<p>I wept: for I had longed to see him hanged.</p>
</div></div>

<p>His zeal for his tongue was real. As he lay upon his
death-bed making his confession after so vigorous a life, he
heard his nurse say something to herself which sounded
ungrammatical and, turning round from the priest, he put
her right in a manner most violent and sudden. His confessor,
startled, said: "The time is not relevant." "All
times are relevant!" he answered, sinking back. "I will
defend with my last breath the purity and grandeur of the
French tongue."</p>

<p>To such a man the meaning of the solution at which his
people had arrived after a century of civil war lay, above
all, in their ancient religion. On that converged those
deeper and more permanent things in his soul of which
even his patriotism and his literary zeal were but the surface.
In the expression of that final solution his verse,
which was hardly that of a poet, rises high into poetry;
under the heat and pressure of his faith, single lines here
and there have crystallized into diamonds. By far the most
vigorous of so many frigid odes is the battle cry addressed
by him in old age to Louis XIII setting out against La
Rochelle. He visited that siege, but had the misfortune to
die a bare week before the fall of the city. The most powerful
of his sonnets, or rather the only powerful one, is that
in which he calls to Our Lord for vengeance against the
men who killed his son. Catholicism in its every effect,
political and personal, as it were literary too, possessed the
man, so that in ending the types of the French Renaissance
with him you see how the terms in which ultimately the
French express themselves are and will remain religious.
The last two lines of his most famous and most Catholic
poem have about them just that sound which saves them,
in spite of their too simple words, from falling into the
vulgar commonplace of vague and creedless men. In writing
them down one seems to be writing down the fate of
the great century now tamed, alas! and ordered, as must
be the violence of over-human things:--</p>

<h3>EXTRACTS.</h3>

<p class="mid">(<i><b>From the "Ode to Louis XIII setting out against La Rochelle," and the
"Sonnet on his son's death."</b></i>)</p>



<p>It has been remarked that Malherbe in his most vigorous
years deliberately employed the strength of his mind to the
repression of emotion in his verse, and used it only to
fashion, guide, control, and at last fix permanently the rules
of the language. It is certainly true that as his bodily
vigour declined, a certain unexpected anger and violence
enters into his verse, to the great relief of us moderns: not
to that of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>Of this feature in him, the two following extracts are
sufficient proof. They were written, the first at the close
of his seventy-second, the other at the entry of his seventy-third
year. In each, something close to his heart was at
issue, and in each he gives some vent--far more than had
been his wont--to passion.</p>

<p>The first is a cry to Louis XIII to have done with the
Huguenot. It was written to the camp before La Rochelle.
I know of nothing in French literature which more expresses
the intense current of national feeling against the
nobility and rich townsmen who had attempted to warp
the national tradition and who had re-introduced into
French life the element which France works perpetually to
throw out as un-European, ill-cultured and evil. Indeed,
the reading of it is of more value to the comprehension of
the national attitude than any set history you may read.</p>

<p>The second is in its way a thing equally religious and
equally catholic. This call for vengeance to God was not
only an expression of anger called forth by his son's death,
it was also, and very largely, the effect of a reaction against
the ethics of Geneva: an attack on the idolatry at once of
meekness and of fatality which was to him so intolerable a
corruption of the Christian religion.</p>

<p>There is some doubt as to whether it is his last work.
I believe it to be so; but Blaise, in his excellent edition,
prints the dull and unreadable ode to Lagade later, and
ascribes it to the same year.</p>

<h3>EXTRACTS FROM
THE "CONSOLATION OF DU PERRIER."</h3>

<p>These stanzas, which are among the best-known as they
are, in the opinion of many, the dullest, in French literature,
serve well to close this book.</p>

<p>One verse at least (the fourth) is most legitimately famous,
though it is hackneyed from the constant repetition of fools.
For the rest a certain simplicity, a great precision, may or
may not atone for their deliberate coldness.</p>

<p>What is certain is that, poetry or not, they admirably
express the spirit of his pen and its prodigious effect. They
express the classical end of the French Renaissance with
as much weight and hardness as the great blank walls of
stone that were beginning to show in the rebuilding of
Paris. It is for this quality that I have printed them here,
using them as the definite term of that long, glorious, and
uncertain phase in European letters.</p>

<h3><a href="#ch1">CHARLES OF ORLEANS.</a></h3>

<p><a href="#ch1a">THE COMPLAINT.</a></p>

<p>Line 5. <i>Prins.</i> An inaccurate pedantic past participle of
<i>prendre</i>.</p>

<p>Line 14. <i>Faulse.</i> There is to be noted here and elsewhere throughout
these extracts, until the modern spelling at the close of the period,
the redundant "l" in many words. It was an effect of pure pedantry.
The latin "l" had become <i>u</i> in northern French. <i>Falsa</i> made,
naturally,
"Fausse." The partial learning of the later middle ages reintroduced
an "l" which was not known to be transformed, but was
thought omitted.</p>

<p>Line 24. <i>Liesse.</i> One of the commonest words of this epoch, lost to
modern French. It means joy=<i>laetitia</i>.</p>

<p>Line 25. Note the gender of "Amour," feminine even in the singular
throughout the middle ages and renaissance--right up to the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p><a href="#ch1b">THE TWO ROUNDELS OF SPRING.</a></p>

<p>I</p>

<p>Line 1. <i>Fourriers.</i> The servants who go before to find lodging. The
term survives in French military terminology. The <i>Fourriers</i> are the
non-commissioned officers and party who go forward and mark the
Billeting of a regiment.</p>

<p>Line 9. <i>Pieça=il y a pièce</i>; "lately". <i>Cf.</i> <i>naguère</i>="<i>il
n'y a
guère...."</i></p>

<p>Line 11. <i>Prenez pais</i>="take the fields," begone.</p>

<p>Line 19. Note "<i>Chant</i>," the regular form of the subjunctive=<i>Cantet</i>.
The only latin vowel preserved after the tonic syllable is a=French
e (mute). Thus <i>contat</i>="chante" which form has in modern
French usurped the subjunctive.</p>

<p>Line 23. <i>Livrée</i>="Liberata," <i>i.e.</i>, things given out. A term originally
applied not only to clothing, but to the general allowance of the
king's household. Hence our word "livery."</p>




<p><a href="#ch1c">"THE FAREWELL".</a></p>

<p>Line 2. <i>Chiere lie.</i> "Happy countenance." <i>Chiere</i> here is the
substantive, <i>lie</i>=<i>laeta</i>, is the adjective. <i>Bonne chère</i> means "a good time"
where <i>chère</i> is an old word for "head" (Greek: kara).</p>

<p>Line 5. <i>Baillie</i>=Bailliwick, "For Age that has me now within her
bounds."</p>

<p>Line 7. <i>Mye.</i> "Crumb." "I am not a whit (not a crumb) with her
(<i>Joie</i>) to-day."</p>

<p>Line 15. "Well braced," literally "well girthed" (as a horse is).</p>

<h3><a href="#ch2">VILLON.</a></h3>

<p><a href="#ch2a">THE DEAD LADIES.</a></p>

<p>Stanza 1, line 1. Note the redundant negative; it is characteristic
of mediaeval French, as of all primitive work, that the general suggestion
of doubt is sufficient to justify a redundant negative.</p>

<p>Line 2. <i>Flora</i>, etc. It is worth while knowing who these women
were. <i>Flora</i> is Juvenal's Flora (Sat. II. 9), a legend in the university. Of
<i>Archipiada</i> I know nothing. <i>Thaïs</i> was certainly the Egyptian courtesan
turned anchoress and canonized, famous in the middle ages and revived
to-day in the repulsive masterpiece of M. Anatole France. <i>Elois</i> is, of
course, <i>Heloïse</i>, and <i>Esbaillart</i> is Abelard. The queen, who in the
legend had Buridan (and many others) drowned, was the Dowager of
Burgundy that lived in the Tour de Nesle, where the Palais Mazarin
is now, and had half the university for a lover: in sober history she
founded that college of Burgundy from which the École de Médecine is
descended; the legend about her is first heard of (save in this poem) in
1471, from the pen of a German in Leipzig. <i>Blanche</i> may be Blanche
of Castille, but more likely she was a vision of Villon's own, for what
did St. Louis' mother ever sing? <i>Berte</i> is the legendary mother of Charlemagne
in the Epics; <i>Beatris</i> is any Beatrice you choose, for they have all
died. <i>Allis</i> may just possibly be one of the Troubadour heroines, more
likely she is here introduced for rhyme and metre; <i>Haremburgis</i> is strictly
historical: she was the Heiress of Maine who married Foulque of Anjou
in 1110 and died in 1126: an ancestress, therefore, of the Plantagenets.
<i>Jehanne</i> is, of course, Joan of Arc.</p>

<p>Line 8. <i>D'Antan</i> is <i>not</i> "Yester-year." It is "Ante annum," all
time past before <i>this</i> year. Rossetti's "Yester-year" moreover, is an
absurd and affected neologism; "Antan" is an excellent and living
French word.</p>

<p>Stanza II., line 2. Note the pronunciation of "Moyne" to rhyme
(more or less) with "eine": the oi, ai and ei sounds were very similar
till the sixteenth century at earliest. They are interchangeable in many
popular provincialisms and in some words, <i>e.g.</i>, Fouet, pronounced
"Foit" the same tendency survives. The transition began in the beginning
of the seventeenth century as we learn from Vaugelas: and the
influence towards the modern sound came from the Court.</p>

<p>Stanza III., line 2. <i>Seraine</i>="Syren."</p>

<p>Line 5. "<i>Jehanne</i>," "<i>Jehan</i>," in spite of the classical survival in
their spelling, were monosyllables from the earliest times.</p>

<p>Line 7. The "<i>elles</i>" here would not scan but for the elided "e" in
"<i>souv'raine</i>" at the end of the line. In some editions "<i>ils</i>" is found
and <i>souveraine</i> is spelt normally. <i>Ils</i> and <i>els</i> for a feminine plural existed
in the middle ages.</p>

<p><i>Envoi.</i> The envoi needs careful translation. The "que" of the third
line="sans que" and the whole means, "Do not ask this week or this
year where they are, <i>without</i> letting this refrain haunt you." "Que"
might possibly mean "de peur que," did not the whole sense of the
poem forbid such an interpretation.</p>

<p><a href="#ch2b">AN EXCERPT FROM THE GRANT TESTAMENT.</a></p>

<p>Stanza 75, line 4. A charming example of those "flashes" which
reveal Villon.</p>

<p>Stanza 76, line 2. Note the spelling of <i>Grant</i> in the feminine without
an <i>e</i>. Adjectives of the third declension whose feminine was not
distinguishable in Latin took no "e" in early French. A survival of
this is found in grand' rue, grand' messe, etc.</p>

<p>Line 5. <i>Grant erre</i>, "quickly," and the whole line reads: "Let it
(my body) be delivered to it (luy=la terre) quickly," the "erre" here
is from the popular late Latin "<i>iterare</i>"="<i>iter facere</i>." It survives in
the nautical idiom "reprendre son erre"="to get under weigh again."</p>

<p>Line 7. "<i>Erre</i>" here comes, on the contrary, from <i>errare</i>, to make a
mistake, to err.</p>

<p>Stanza 77, line 4. <i>Maillon.</i> Swaddling clothes.</p>

<p>Line 5. <i>Boullon</i>, scrape. The two lines are obscure but seem to
read: "He has got me out of many a scrape which gave him no joy"
(<i>esioye</i> from <i>esjouir</i>=<i>rejouir</i>).</p>

<p>Line 7 and 8. These are obscure but apparently="And beseech
him on my knees not to forsake all joy on that account."</p>

<p>Stanza 78, line 2. "<i>Le Romman du Pet au Deable</i>." The Pet au
Deable was a great stone at the door of a private house in the university.
The students took it away and all Paris fought over the matter. The
"Roman" was a set of verses, now lost, which Villon wrote on the quarrel.</p>

<p>Line 3. <i>Guy Tabarie</i> who <i>grossa</i> (wrote out), these verses was a friend
of Villon's: soon hanged.</p>

<p>Line 5. <i>Soubz.</i> The "b" is pedantic, the <i>ou</i> indicates of itself the
loss of the <i>b</i>. The "z" (and the "s" in the modern <i>sous</i>) are due to
the derivation not from <i>sub</i> but <i>subtus</i>.</p>


<p><a href="#ch2c">THE BALLAD OF OUR LADY.</a></p>

<p>Stanza 2, line 3. <i>Egypcienne.</i> St. Mary of Egypt.</p>

<p>Line 4. <i>Theophilus.</i> This was that clerk who sold his soul to the
Devil and whom Our Lady redeemed. You may find the whole story
sculptured on the Tympanum of the exquisite northern door of Notre
Dame in Paris.</p>

<p>Line 8. <i>Vierge Portant</i>="Virgin that bore a son."</p>

<p>Stanza 3, line 4. <i>Luz</i>="luthus." "S" becomes "z."</p>

<p>The Envoi. Note the Acrostic "Villon" in the first letters of the
first six lines. It is a trick he played more than once.</p>

<p><a href="#ch2d">THE DEAD LORDS.</a></p>

<p>Stanza 1, line 1. <i>Calixte.</i> These names are of less interest. <i>Calixte</i>
was Pope Calixtus III., Alphonso Borgia, who died in 1458--in
Villon's twenty-sixth year. <i>Alphonse</i> is Alphonso V of Arragon, who
died in that same year. The <i>Duc de Bourbon</i> is Charles the First of
Bourbon, who died at the end of the year 1456, "gracieux" because his
son protected Villon. <i>Artus</i> (Arthur) of Brittany is that same Richemont
who recaptured Paris from Willoughby. Charles VII is Charles
VII. The <i>Roy Scotiste</i> is James II., who died in 1460: the <i>Amethyst</i>
half of his face was a birthmark. The <i>King of Cyprus</i> is probably John
III., who died in that same fatal year, 1458. Pedants will have it that
the <i>King of Spain</i> is John II of Castille, who died in 1454--but it is a
better joke if it means nobody at all. <i>Lancelot</i> is Vladislas of Bohemia,
who died in 1457. <i>Cloquin</i> is Bertrand de Guesclin who led the reconquest.
<i>The Count Daulphin</i> of Auvergne is doubtful; <i>Alençon</i> is presumably
the Alençon of Joan of Arc's campaign, who still survived, and
is called "feu" half in ridicule, because in 1458 he had lost his title and
lands for treason.</p>

<p>Stanza 2, line 3. <i>Amatiste</i>=amethyst.</p>

<p>Stanza 3, line 7. <i>Tayon</i>=Ancestor. "<i>Etallum.</i>" Latin "<i>Stallio</i>."</p>

<p><a href="#ch2e">THE DIRGE.</a></p>

<p>Line 1. <i>Cil</i>=celui-ci. The Latin "<i>ecce illum</i>."</p>

<p>Line 3. <i>Escuelle</i>=bowl. "With neither bowl nor platter."</p>

<p>Line 4. Note again the constant redundant negative of the populace
in this scholar: "Had never, no--not a sprig of parsley."</p>

<p>Line 5. <i>Rez</i>=ras, cropped.</p>

<h3><a href="#ch3">MAROT.</a></h3>

<p><a href="#ch3a">OF COURTING LONG AGO.</a></p>

<p>Line 5. <i>On se prenoit</i>, one attacked--"it was but the heart one
sought."</p>

<p>Line 11. <i>Fainctz</i>=sham; "<i>changes</i>" is simply like the English
"changes": the form survives in the idiom: "donner le change."</p>

<p>Line 13. <i>Refonde</i>=recast.</p>

<p><a href="#ch3b">NOËL.</a></p>

<p>Verse 1, line 3. <i>L'Autre hyer</i>=alterum heri, "t'other day."</p>

<p>Line 10. <i>Noé.</i> The tendency to drop final letters, especially the
<i>l</i>, is very marked in popular patois, and this is, of course, a song based
on popular language. Most French peasants north of the Loire would
still say "Noé" for "Noël." <i>Noël</i> is, of course, <i>Natalem</i> (diem).</p>

<p>Verse 2, line 2. <i>Cas de si hault faict</i>=so great a matter.</p>

<p><a href="#ch3c">TWO EPIGRAMS.</a></p>
<p>Epigram 1, line 2. <i>Vostre.</i> Marguerite of Navarre. As I have
remarked, in the text, she had sent him a Dixaine (some say he wrote
it himself). This one is written in answer.--<i>Ay.</i> Note, till the verb
grew over simple in the classical French of the seventeenth century
there was no more need for the pronoun than in Latin. Thus Montaigne
will omit the pronoun, but Malherbe never.</p>

<p>Line 5. <i>Cuydans</i>=thinking (<i>Cogitare</i>=<i>Cogtare</i>=<i>Coyde</i>=<i>cuider</i>, the
<i>oi</i> became <i>ui</i> by a common transition; <i>cf.</i> noctem, octem, noit, nuit,
huit.) The word is now archaic.</p>

<p>Line 9. <i>Encor.</i> Without the final e. This is not archaic but poetic
licence. <i>Encore</i>="hanc horam," and a post tonic "am" in Latin always
means a final mute e in French.</p>

<p>Epigram 2, line 1. <i>Maint</i> (now archaic) is a word of Teutonic origin,
our <i>many</i>.</p>

<p>Line 6. <i>Coulpe</i>=Culpam, of course; a fault.</p>

<p>Line 9. <i>Emport</i>. Note the old subjunctive without the final e. <i>Vide
supra</i>, on "<i>Chant</i>." The modern usage is incorrect. For the first conjugation
making its subjunctive in <i>em</i>, should lose the final syllable in
French: a post tonic <i>em</i> always disappears. The modern habit of putting
a final e to all subjunctives is due to a false analogy with verbs from the
third conjugation. These made their subjunctive in <i>am</i>, a termination
which properly becomes the mute e of French.</p>

<p><a href="#ch3d">TO HIS LADY IN SICKNESS.</a></p>

<p>Line 4. <i>Sejour</i>=(here) "staying at home."</p>

<p>Line 14, 15. <i>Friande de la bouche</i>, glutton.</p>

<p>Line 17. <i>Danger.</i> The first meaning of "Danger" is simply "to be
in lordship" (Dominicarium). The modern is the English "Danger."
This is between the two; "held to your hurt."</p>

<p>Line 26. <i>Doint.</i> This subjunctive should properly be <i>don</i> (<i>donem</i>,
post tonic <i>em</i> is lost). The "oint" is from a false analogy with the fourth
conjugation, as though the Latin had been <i>doniam</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#ch3e">THE VINEYARD SONG.</a></p>

<p>Verse 1, line 2. <i>Clamours.</i> See how southern this is, with its
Lanquedoc forms, "clamours" for "clam<i>eurs</i>."</p>

<p>Line 5. So are these diminutions all made up at random, as southern
as can be, and note the tang of the verse, fit for a snapping of the
fingers to mark the rapid time.</p>

<p>Verse 3, line 2. <i>Bénistre.</i> The older form of <i>bénir</i> from <i>Benedicere</i>;
the <i>c</i> between vowels at the end of the tonic syllable becomes <i>s</i>: the <i>t</i>
is added for euphony, to help one to pronounce the <i>s</i>.</p>

<p>Line 3. <i>Silenus</i> for <i>Silène</i>. Because the name was new, the Latin form
is kept. The genius of the French, unlike that of modern English, is to
absorb a foreign name (as we did once). Thus once we said "Anthony"
"Tully": but Montaigne wrote "Cicero"--his descendants say
"Ciceron."</p>

<p>Line 4. <i>Aussi droict qu'une ligne</i>="right out of the flask." The flask
held above one and the wine poured straight into the mouth. The
happy south still know the way.</p>

<p>Line 5. <i>Bigne</i>: a lump, a knock, a bruise.</p>

<p>Line 6. <i>Guigne</i>=cherry.</p>




<p><a href="#ch4">RONSARD.</a></p>

<p><a href="#ch4a">DIALOGUE WITH THE NINE SISTERS.</a></p>

<p>Stanza 1, line 3. <i>Chef grison</i>=gray head. When he says "trente
ans," that is all rubbish, he was getting on for forty-three: it was written
in 1567.</p>

<p>Stanza 2, line 1. <i>Nocher</i>=pilot; rare but hardly archaic.</p>

<p>Stanza 3, line 3. <i>Cependant</i>=meanwhile. The word is now seldom
used in prose, save in the sense of "notwithstanding," "nevertheless."</p>

<p>Stanza 5, line 1. <i>Loyer</i>=Condition of tenure.</p>

<p>Line 2. <i>Ores</i>=Now that. Should be "<i>ore</i>" (horam). The parasitic
"s" probably crept in by false analogy with the adverbs in "s."</p>

<p>Stanza 6, line 1. <i>Lame</i>=tombstone. The word is no longer
used.</p>

<p>Line 4. See how, even in his lighter or prosaic manner, he cannot
avoid great lines.</p>

<p>Stanza 8, line 1. <i>Vela</i>=Voilà. Then follows that fine ending which
I have put on the title-page of this book.</p>

<p><a href="#ch4b">"MIGNONNE ALLONS VOIR SI LA ROSE."</a></p>

<p>Line 1. <i>Mignonne</i> is, of course, his Cassandre: her personality was
always known through his own verse. She was fifteen when he met her
and her brown eyes: it was in 1546 at Blois, her birthplace, whither
he had gone to visit the Court, during his scholar's life in Paris. He met
her thus young when he himself was but in his twenty-third year, and all
that early, violent, not over-tilled beginning of his poetry was illumined
by her face. But as to who she was, by name I mean, remained long a
matter of doubt. Binet would have it that her true name was Cassandre,
and that its singularity inspired Ronsard. Brantôme called it "a false
name to cover a true." Ronsard himself has written, "false or true, time
conquering all things cannot efface it from the marble." There need
have been no doubt. D'Aubigné's testimony is sufficient. She was a
Mlle de Pie, and such was the vagary of Ronsard's life, that it was her
niece, Diane Salviati de Taley whom in later life he espoused and
nearly wed.</p>

<p>Line 3. Note <i>Pourpre</i>, and in line 5 <i>Pourprée</i> so in line 9 <i>Beautez</i>,
and in the last line <i>Beauté</i>: so little did he fear repetition and so heartily
could his power carry it.</p>

<p>Line 4. <i>A point</i>: the language was still in flux. The phrase would
require a negative <i>n'</i> in modern French.</p>

<p>Line 10, 11. <i>Marastre... puisqu'une...</i> There is here an elliptical
construction never found in later French. Harsh stepmother nature
(whom I call harsh) since..." etc.</p>

<p><a href="#ch4c">SONNETS FOR HÉLÈNE.</a></p>

<p>Sonnet xlii., line 1. <i>Ocieuse</i>="otiosa," langorous.</p>

<p>Line 5. <i>Ennuy</i>, in the sixteenth century meant something fuller than,
and somewhat different from the word "ennui" to-day. It was a
weariness which had in it some permanent chagrin.</p>

<p>Line 8. <i>Pipe</i>, "cajoles": a word which (now that it is unusual) mars
the effect of its meaning by its insignificant sound.</p>

<p>Lines 8 and 9. Note <i>ioye</i>, <i>vraye</i>, a feminine "e" following another
vowel is, since Malherbe, forbidden in the interior of a verse, unless
elided.</p>

<p>Line 11. <i>Ton mort</i>, "your ghost."</p>

<p>Sonnet xliii., line 6. <i>Desia</i>=dejà.</p>

<p>Line 7. <i>De mon nom.</i> I have printed the line thus because Ronsard
himself wished it so, and so corrected it with his own hand. But the

<p>Line 3. <i>Usage.</i> A most powerful word in this slightly archaic sense:
the experience of long travel: familiar knowledge of things seen.</p>

<p>Line 12. <i>Loire.</i> This word has puzzled more than one editor. There
are two rivers: the great river Loire, which is feminine, and the little
Loir, which is masculine. Here Du Bellay spells the name of the great
river, but puts it in the masculine gender. It has been imagined that
he was talking of the smaller river. But he was not. The Loire alone
has any connection with Liré or with his life, and as for the gender,
strained as the interpretation may seem, I believe that Du Bellay
deliberately used it in the parallel with the Tiber and the idea of the
"Fleuve Paternel," to which he alludes so often elsewhere.</p>

<p>Line 13. <i>Lyré.</i> The modern Liré, his birthplace, on the left bank
of the Loire, just opposite Ancenis. As you go along the Poitiers road
to the bridge it stands up on your right, just before the river.</p>

<p>Line 1. <i>Motte</i>=a turf.</p>

<p>Line 40. <i>Damoiselet.</i> Still used more or less in its old sense of a young
man <i>armed</i>: not merely a young page or a cadet of the gentry,="like
a little sentry."</p>

<p>Line 43. <i>Anvie</i>=(of course) "envie."</p>

<p>Line 26. <i>Panne</i>=the Italian <i>Panno</i>--cloth.</p>

<p>Line 27. <i>Troigne</i>=the mouth and face of an animal, the muzzle.</p>

<p>Line 32. <i>Chere</i>=(originally) "head" and one of the few old French
words derived from Greek, but the first signification has long been lost.
Here the phrase is equivalent to "faire bonne chere" which has for
centuries been used proverbially for what we call "a good time." <i>V.

<p>Stanza 3, line 1. <i>Centième.</i> He dates the Huguenot trouble from a
century. It may be said to have originated in the placards threatening
the defilement of the Sacrament, placards which appeared in the streets
of Paris in 1525.</p>

<p>Stanza 2, line 3. <i>Le nom de Juste.</i> Louis XIII had no particular
affectation of that title: it is rather a reminiscence of his distant collatoral
and namesake who closed the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Last stanza, line 1. <i>Toutes les autres morts.</i> He has just been speaking
of death in battle against the factions.</p>

<p><a href="#ch6b">SONNET ON HIS SON'S DEATH.</a></p>

<p>Line 1. <i>Mon fils.</i> The only survivor of his many children, a young
man, just called to the bar at Aix and passionately loved by his father,
he bore the curious name of Marc-Anthony. A M. de Piles killed him
in a duel, having for second his brother-in-law. The whole was an
honourable bit of business, and the death such as men of honour must
be prepared to risk: but Malherbe would see no reason and defamed
the adversary.</p>

<p>Line 9. <i>La Raison.</i> The idea runs all through Malherbe's work. It
is his distinguishing note, and is the spirit which differentiates him so
powerfully from the sixteenth century, that this stoical balance or
regulator which he calls "La Raison," and which governed France for
two hundred years, is his rule and text for verse and prose as well as for
practical life. Even the grandeur to which it gave rise seemed to him
accidental. He demanded "la raison" only, and felt the necessity of it
in art as acutely as though its absence were something immoral.</p>

<p><a href="#ch6c">EXTRACTS FROM THE "CONSOLATION OF DU PERRIER."</a></p>

<p>Stanza 1, line 1. <i>Duperrier.</i> A critic of sorts and a gentleman, living
in Provence and perhaps of Provençal ancestry. The verses were
written while Malherbe's fame was still local, two years before the king's
visit had lifted him to Paris.</p>

<p>Stanza 2, line 2. <i>Ta fille.</i> The child Marguerite. Her name does
not appear in the poem nor in any letter; we have it from Racan.</p>

<p>Stanza 10, line 3. <i>Et la garde, etc.</i> These two lines are quoted,
sometimes, not often, by admirers who would prove that Malherbe was
not incapable of colour or of warmth.</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
